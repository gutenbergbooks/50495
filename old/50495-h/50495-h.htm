    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS volume is
      written to show the life of the students in the Paris of to-day. It has an
      additional interest in opening to inspection certain phases of Bohemian
      life in Paris that are shared both by the students and the public, but
      that are generally unfamiliar to visitors to that wonderful city, and even
      to a very large part of the city's population itself. It depicts the
      under-side of such life as the students find,&mdash;the loose,
      unconventional life of the humbler strugglers in literature and art, with
      no attempt to spare its salient features, its poverty and picturesqueness,
      and its lack of adherence to generally accepted standards of morals and
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      As is told in the article describing that incomparably brilliant
      spectacle, the ball of the Four Arts, extreme care is taken to exclude the
      public and admit only artists and students, all of whom must be properly
      accredited and fully identified. It is well understood that such a
      spectacle would not be suitable for any but artists and students. It is
      given solely for their benefit, and with the high aim, fully justified by
      the experience of the masters who direct the students, that the event,
      with its marvellous brilliancy, its splendid artistic effects, and its
      freedom and abandon, has a stimulating and broadening effect of the
      greatest value to art. The artists and students see in these annual
      spectacles only grace, beauty, and majesty; their training in the studios,
      where they learn to regard models merely as tools of their craft, fits
      them, and them alone, for the wholesome enjoyment of the great ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a student that presents the insight which this volume gives into the
      life of the students and other Bohemians of Paris. It is set forth with
      the frankness of a student. Coming from such a source, and having such
      treatment, it will have a special charm and value for the wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students are the pets of Paris. They lend to the city a
      picturesqueness that no other city enjoys. So long as they avoid riots
      aimed at a government that may now and then offend their sense of right,
      their ways of living, their escapades, their noisy and joyous
      manifestations of healthy young animal life, are good-naturedly
      overlooked. Underneath such a life there lies, concealed from casual view,
      another life that they lead,&mdash;one of hard work, of hope, of
      aspiration, and often of pinching poverty and cruel self-denial. The
      stress upon them, of many kinds, is great. The utter absence of an effort
      to reorganize their lives upon conventional lines is from a philosophical
      belief that if they fail to pass unscathed through it all, they lack the
      fine, strong metal from which worthy artists are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger in Paris will here find opened to him places in which he may
      study for himself the Bohemian life of the city in all its careless
      disregard of conventions. The cafés, cabarets, and dance-halls herein
      described and illustrated have a charm that wholesome, well-balanced minds
      will enjoy. The drawings for the illustrations were all made from the
      actual scenes that they depict; they partake of the engaging frankness of
      the text and of its purpose to show Bohemian life in the Paris of to-day
      without any effort at concealment.

    <h2>
      OUR STUDIO
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E were in
      wonderful Paris at last&mdash;Bishop and I&mdash;after a memorable passage
      full of interest from New York to Havre. Years of hard work were ahead of
      us, for Bishop would be an artist and I a sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two weeks we had been lodging temporarily in the top of a comfortable
      little hotel, called the Grand something (most of the Parisian hotels are
      Grand), the window of which commanded a superb view of the great city, the
      vaudeville playhouse of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pour la première fois</i> the dazzle and glitter had burst upon us,
      confusing first, but now assuming form and coherence. If we and
      incomprehensible at could have had each a dozen eyes instead of two, or
      less greed to see and more patience to learn!
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day we had put off the inevitable evil of finding a studio. Every
      night found us in the cheapest seats of some theatre, and often we lolled
      on the terraces of the Café de la Paix, watching the pretty girls as they
      passed, their silken skirts saucily pulled up, revealing dainty laces and
      ankles. From the slippery floor of the Louvre galleries we had studied the
      masterpieces of David, Rubens, Rembrandt, and the rest; had visited the
      Panthéon, the Musée Cluny; had climbed the Eiffel Tower, and traversed the
      Bois de Boulogne and the Champs-Elysées. Then came the search for a studio
      and the settling to work. It would be famous to have a little home of our
      very own, where we could have little dinners of our very own cooking!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is with a shudder that I recall those eleven days of ceaseless
      studio-hunting. We dragged ourselves through miles of Quartier Latin
      streets, and up hundreds of flights of polished waxed stairs, behind
      puffing concierges in carpet slippers, the puffing changing to grumbling,
      as, dissatisfied, the concierges followed us down the stairs. The Quartier
      abounds with placards reading, "<i>Atelier d'Artiste à Louer!</i>" The
      rentals ranged from two hundred to two thousand francs a year, and the
      sizes from cigar-boxes to barns. But there was always something lacking.
      On the eleventh day we found a suitable place on the sixth (top) floor of
      a quaint old house in a passage off the <i>Rue St.- André-des-Arts</i>.
      There were overhead and side lights, and from the window a noble view of
      Paris over the house-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0023.jpg" alt="0023 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0023.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      A room of fair size joined the studio, and from its vine-laced window we
      could look into the houses across the court, and down to the bottom of the
      court as well. The studio walls were delightfully dirty and low in tone,
      and were covered with sketches and cartoons in oil and charcoal. The price
      was eight hundred francs a year, and from the concierge's eloquent
      catalogue of its charms it seemed a great bargain. The walls settled our
      fate,&mdash;we took the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one thing to agree on the price and another to settle the details.
      Our French was ailing, and the concierge's French was&mdash;concierges'
      French. Bishop found that his pet theory that French should be spoken with
      the hands, head, and shoulders carried weak spots which a concierge could
      discover; and then, being somewhat mercurial, he began floundering in a
      mixture of French and English words and French and American gestures,
      ending in despair with the observation that the concierge was a d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      fool. At the end of an hour we had learned that we must sign an
      iron-bound, government-stamped contract, agreeing to occupy the studio for
      not less than one year, to give six months' notice of our leaving, and to
      pay three months' rental in advance, besides the taxes for one year on all
      the doors and windows, and ten francs or more to the concierge. This was
      all finally settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no running water in the rooms (such a luxury being unknown
      here), we had to supply our needs from a clumsy old iron pump in the
      court, and employ six flights of stairs in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the studio had to be furnished, and there came endless battles with
      the furniture dealers in the neighborhood, who kept their stock
      replenished from the goods of bankrupt artists and suspended ménages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0025.jpg" alt="0025 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0025.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      These <i>marchands de meubles</i> are a wily race, but Bishop pursued a
      plan in dealing with them that worked admirably. He would enter a shop and
      price an article that we wanted, and then throw up his hands in horror and
      leave the place as though it were haunted with a plague. The dealer would
      always come tumbling after him and offer him the article for a half or a
      third of the former price. In this way Bishop bought chairs, tables, a
      large easel, beds, a studio stove, book-shelves, linen, drapings, water
      pitchers and buckets, dishes, cooking utensils, and many other things, the
      cost of the whole being less than one hundred and fifty francs,&mdash;and
      thus we were established. The studio became quite a snug and hospitable
      retreat, in spite of the alarming arrangement that Bishop adopted, "to
      help the composition of the room." His favorite cast, the Unknown Woman,
      occupied the place of honor over his couch, where he could see it the
      first thing in the morning, when the dawn, stealing through the skylight,
      brought out those strange and subtle features which he swore inspired him
      from day to day. My room was filled with brilliant posters by Chéret and
      Mucha and Steinlen,&mdash;they were too bold and showy for the low tone of
      Bishop's studio. It all made a pretty picture,&mdash;the dizzy posters,
      the solemn trunks, the books, the bed with its gaudy print coverings, and
      the little crooked-pane window hung with bright green vines that ran
      thither from a box in the window of an adjoining apartment. And it was all
      completed by the bright faces of three pretty seamstresses, who sat sewing
      every day at their window across the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under our housekeeping agreement Bishop was made cook, and I chambermaid
      and water-carrier. It was Bishop's duty to obey the alarm clock at six
      every morning and light the fire, while I went down for water at the pump,
      and for milk at the stand beside the court entrance, where fat Madame
      Gioté sold <i>café-au-lait</i> and <i>lait froid ou chaud</i>, from a <i>sou</i>'s
      worth up. Then, after breakfast, I did the chamber work while Bishop
      washed the dishes. Bishop could make for breakfast the most delicious
      coffee and flapjacks and omelette in the whole of Paris. By eight o'clock
      all was in order; Bishop was smoking his pipe and singing "Down on the
      Farm" while working on his life study, and I was off to my modelling in
      clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop soon had the hearts of all the shop-keepers in the neighborhood.
      The baker's dimple-cheeked daughter never worried if the scales hung a
      little in his favor, at the boucherie he was served with the choicest cuts
      of meat, and the fried-potato women called him "<i>mon fils</i>" and fried
      a fresh lot of potatoes for him. Even Madame Tonneau, the <i>marchande de
      tabac</i>, saw that he had the freshest packages in the shop. Often, when
      I was returning home at night, I encountered him making cheerily for the
      studio, bearing bread by the yard, his pockets bulging with other material
      for dinner. Ah, he was a wonderful cook, and we had marvellous appetites!
      So famous did he soon become that the models (the lady ones, of course)
      were eager to dine <i>avec nous</i>; and when they did they helped to set
      the table, they sewed buttons on our clothes, and they made themselves
      agreeable and perfectly at home with that charming grace which is so
      peculiarly French. Ah, those were jolly times!
    </p>
    <p>
      The court, or, more properly, <i>le passage</i>, on which our window
      looked was a narrow little thoroughfare leading from the Rue
      St.-André-des-Arts to the Boulevard St.-Germain. It bore little traffic,
      but was a busy way withal. It had iron-workers' shops, where hot iron was
      beaten into artistic lamps, grills, and bed-frames; a tinsmith's shop; a
      blanchisserie, where our shirts were made white and smooth by the pretty
      blanchisseuses singing all day over their work; a wine-cellar, whose
      barrels were eternally blocking one end of the passage; an embossed
      picture-card factory, where twoscore women, with little hammers and steel
      dies, beat pictures into cards; a furniture shop, where everything old and
      artistic was sold, the Hôtel du Passage, and a bookbinder's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the eight buildings facing the passage was ruled by a formidable
      concierge, who had her dark little living apartments near the entrances.
      These are the despots of the court, and their function is to make life
      miserable for their lodgers. When they are not doing that they are
      eternally scrubbing and polishing. They are all married. M. Mayé, <i>le
      mari de notre concierge</i>, is a tailor. He sits at the window and mends
      and sews all day long, or acts as concierge when his wife is away. The
      husband of the concierge next door is a sergeant de ville at night, but in
      the early mornings as, in a soiled blouse, he empties ash-cans, he looks
      very unlike the personage dressed at night in a neat blue uniform and
      wearing a short sword Another concierge's husband <i>fait des courses</i>&mdash;runs
      errands&mdash;for sufficient pay.

      Should you fail to clean your boots on the mat, and thus soil the glossy
      stairs, have a care!&mdash;a concierge's tongue has inherited the warlike
      characteristics of the Caesars. Rugs and carpets must not be shaken out of
      the windows after nine o'clock. Ashes and other refuse must be thrown into
      the big bin of the house not later than seven. Sharp at eleven in the
      evening the lights are extinguished and the doors locked for the night;
      and then all revelry must immediately cease. Should you arrive <i>en
      retard</i>,&mdash;that is, after eleven,&mdash;you must ring the bell
      violently until the despot, generally after listening for an hour to the
      bell, unlocks the catch from her couch. Then when you close the door and
      pass her lodge you must call out your name. If you are out often or till
      very late, be prepared for a lecture on the crime of breaking the rest of
      hard-working concierges. After the day's work the concierges draw their
      chairs out into the court and gossip about their tenants. The nearer the
      roof the lodger the less the respect he commands. Would he not live on a
      lower floor if he were able? And then, the top floor gives small tips!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is noticeable that the entresol and premiers étages are clean and
      highly polished, and that the cleanliness and polish diminish steadily
      toward the top, where they almost disappear. Ah, <i>les concierges!</i>
      But what would Paris be without them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly beneath us an elderly couple have apartments. Every morning at
      five the old gentleman starts French oaths rattling through the court by
      beating his rugs out of his window. At six he rouses the ire of a widow
      below him by watering his plants and incidentally drenching her bird-
      cages. Not long ago she rose in violent rebellion, and he hurled a flower
      pot at her protruding head. It smashed on her window-sill; she screamed
      "Murder!" and the whole court was in an uproar. The concierges and the old
      gentleman's pacific wife finally restored order&mdash;till the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, to my room are an elderly lady and her sweet, sad-faced daughter.
      They are very quiet and dignified, and rarely fraternize with their
      neighbors. It is their vine that creeps over to my window, and it is
      carefully tended by the daughter. And all the doves and sparrows of the
      court come regularly to eat out of her hand, and a lively chatter they
      have over it. The ladies are the widow and daughter of a once prosperous
      stock-broker on the Bourse, whom an unlucky turn of the wheel drove to
      poverty and suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three seamstresses over the way are the sunshine of the court. They
      are not so busy sewing and singing but that they find time to send arch
      glances toward our window, and their blushes and smiles when Bishop sends
      them sketches of them that he has made from memory are more than
      remunerative.

      A young Scotch student from Glasgow, named Cameron, has a studio adjoining
      ours. He is a fine, jovial fellow, and we usually assist him to dispose of
      his excellent brew of tea at five o'clock. Every Thursday evening there
      was given a musical chez lui, in which Bishop and I assisted with mandolin
      and guitar, while Cameron played the flute. For these occasions Cameron
      donned his breeks and kilt, and danced the sword-dance round two
      table-knives crossed. The American songs strike him as being strange and
      incomprehensible. He cannot understand the negro dialect, and wonders if
      America is filled with negroes and cotton plantations; but he is always
      delighted with Bishop's "Down on the Farm."

      Life begins at five o'clock in our court. The old gentleman beats his
      rugs, the milk-bottles rattle, the bread-carts rumble, Madame Gioté opens
      her milkstand, and the concierges drag the ash-cans out into the court,
      where a drove of rag-pickers fall upon them. These gleaners are a queer
      lot. Individuals and families pursue the quest, each with a distinct
      purpose. One will seek nothing but bones, glass, and crockery; another
      sifts the ashes for coal; another takes only paper and rags; another old
      shoes and hats; and so on, from can to can, none interfering with any of
      the others. The dogs are the first at the bins. They are regularly
      organized in working squads, travelling in fours and fives. They are quite
      adept at digging through the refuse for food, and they rarely quarrel; and
      they never leave one bin for another until they have searched it
      thoroughly.

      The swish of water and a coarse brush broom announces the big, strong
      woman who sweeps the gutters of the Rue St.-André-des-Arts. With broad
      sweeps of the broom she spreads the water over half the street and back
      into the gutter, making the worn yellow stones shine. She is coarsely clad
      and wears black sabots; and God knows how she can swear when the gleaners
      scatter the refuse into the gutter!
    </p>
    <p>
      The long wail of the fish-and-mussel woman, "<i>J'ai des beaux maquereaux,
      des moules, poissons à frire, à frire!</i>" as she pushes her cart, means
      seven o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day now really begins. Water-pails are clanging and sabots are
      clicking on the stones. The wine people set up a rumble by cleaning their
      casks with chains and water. The anvils of the iron-workers are ringing,
      and there comes the tink-tink-tink of the little hammers in the
      embossed-picture factory. The lumbering garbage-cart arrives to bear away
      the ash-bins, the lead-horse shaking his head to ring the bell on his neck
      in announcement of the approach. Street-venders and hawkers of various
      comestibles, each with his or her quaint musical cry, come in numbers. "<i>J'ai
      des beaux choux-fleurs! O, comme ils sont beaux!</i>" The fruit- and
      potato-women come after, and then the chair-menders. These market-women
      are early risers. They are at the great Halles Centrales at four o'clock
      to bargain for their wares; and besides good lungs they have a marvellous
      shrewdness, born of long dealings with French housewives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always near eight may be heard, "<i>Du mouron pour les petits oiseaux!</i>"
      and all the birds in the court, familiar with the cry, pipe up for their
      chickweed. "<i>Voilà le bon fromage à la crème pour trois sous!</i>" cries
      a keen-faced little woman, her three-wheeled cart loaded with cream
      cheeses; and she gives a soup-plate full of them, with cream poured
      generously over, and as she pockets the money says, "<i>Voilà! ce que
      c'est bon avec des confitures!</i>" Cream cheeses and prayer! On Sunday
      mornings during the spring and summer the goat's-milk vender, blowing a
      reed-pipe, invades the passage with his living milk-cans,&mdash;a flock of
      eight hairy goats that know the route as well as he, and they are always
      willing to be milked when a customer offers a bowl. The tripe-man with his
      wares and bell is the last of the food-sellers of the day. The
      window-glass repairer, "<i>Vitrier!</i>" passes at nine, and then the
      beggars and strolling musicians and singers put in an appearance. In the
      afternoon the old-clo' man comes hobbling under his load of cast-off
      clothes, crying, "<i>Marchand d'habits!</i>" of which you can catch only
      "'<i>Chand d'habits!</i>" and the barrel-buyer, "Marchand de tonneaux!"
      The most musical of them all is the porcelain-mender, who cries, "<i>Voici
      le raccommodeur de porcelaines, faïence, cristal, poseur de robinets!</i>"
      and then plays a fragment of a hunting-song.
    </p>

      The beggars and musicians also have regular routes and fixed hours. Cold
      and stormy days are welcomed by them, for then pity lends activity to-
      sous. A piratical old beggar has his stand near the entrance to the court,
      where he kneels on the stones, his faithful mongrel dog beside him. He
      occasionally poses for the artists when times are dull, but he prefers
      begging,&mdash;it is easier and more remunerative. Three times a week we
      are treated to some really good singing by a blind old man, evidently an
      artist in his day. When the familiar sound of his guitar is heard all
      noises in the passage cease, and all windows are opened to hear. He sings
      arias from the operas. His little old wife gathers up the sous that ring
      on the flags. Sometimes a strolling troupe of two actors and three
      musicians makes its appearance, and invariably plays to a full house.
      There are droves of sham singers who do not sing at all, but give mournful
      howls and tell their woes to deaf windows. One of them, a tattered woman
      with two babies, refused to pose for Bishop, although he offered her five
      francs for the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her babies never grow older or bigger as the years pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all know when anybody in the passage is going to take a bath. There are
      no bath-tubs in these old houses, but that difficulty is surmounted by a
      bathing establishment on the Boulevard St.-Michel. It sends around a cart
      bearing a tank of hot water and a zinc tub. The man who pulls the cart
      carries the tub to the room, and fills it by carrying up the water in
      buckets. Then he remains below until the bath is finished, to regain his
      tub and collect a franc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we have been here the court entrance has been once draped in
      mourning. At the head of the casket of old Madame Courtoise, who lived
      across the way, stood a stately crucifix, and candles burned, and there
      were mourners and yellow bead wreaths. A quiet sadness sat upon the court,
      and the people spoke in whispers only.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there have been two weddings,&mdash;one at the blanchisserie, where
      the master's daughter was married to a young mechanic from the iron shop.
      There were glorious times at the laundry that night, for the whole court
      was present. It was four in the morning when the party broke up, and then
      our shirts were two days late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ran the first months of the four years of our student life in Paris;
      in its domestic aspects it was typical of all that followed. We soon
      became members of the American Art Association, and gradually made friends
      in charming French homes. Then there was the strange Bohemian life lying
      outside as well as within the students' pale, and into the spirit of it
      all we found our way. It is to the Bohemian, not the social, life of Paris
      that these papers are devoted&mdash;a life both picturesque and pathetic,
      filled with the oddest contrasts and incongruities, with much suffering
      but more content, and spectacular and fascinating in all its phases. No
      one can have seen and known Paris without a study of this its living,
      struggling artistic side, so strange, so remote from the commonplace world
      surging and roaring unheeded about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On New Year's Day we had an overwhelming number of callers. First came the
      concierge, who cleaned our door-knob and wished us a prosperous and bonne
      année. She got ten francs,&mdash;we did not know what was coming. The chic
      little blanchisseuse called next with our linen. That meant two francs.
      Then came in succession two telegraph boys, the facteur, or postman, who
      presented us with a cheap calendar, and another postman, who delivers only
      second-class mail. They got a franc each. Then the <i>marchand de charbon</i>'s
      boy called with a clean face and received fifty centimes, and everybody
      else with whom we had had dealings; and our offerings had a steadily
      diminishing value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could well bear all this, however, in view of the great day, but a week
      old, when we had celebrated Christmas. Bishop prepared a dinner fit for a
      king, giving the greater part of his time for a week to preparations for
      the great event. Besides a great many French dishes, we had turkey and
      goose, cooked for us at the rôtisserie near by, and soup, oysters,
      American pastries, and a big, blazing plum-pudding. We and our guests
      (there were eight in all) donned full dress for the occasion, and a bonne,
      hired for the evening, brought on the surprises one after another. But why
      should not it have been a glorious evening high up among the chimney-pots
      of old Paris? for did we not drink to the loved ones in a distant land,
      and were not our guests the prettiest among the pretty toilers of our
      court?

      Bishop had condescendingly decided to become <i>un élève de Gérôme</i>&mdash;with
      some misgivings, for Bishop had developed ideas of a large and free
      American art, while Gérôme was hard and academic. One day he gathered up
      some of his best drawings and studies (which he regarded as masterpieces)
      and, climbing to the impériale of a Clichy 'bus, rode over to Montmartre,
      where Gérôme had his private studio. He was politely ushered in by a
      manservant, and conducted to the door of the master's studio through a
      hall and gallery filled with wonderful marble groups. Gérôme himself
      opened the door, and Bishop found himself in the great man's workshop. For
      a moment Bishop stood dazed in the middle of the splendid room, with its
      great sculptures and paintings, some still unfinished, and a famous
      collection of barbaric arms and costumes. A beautiful model was posing
      upon a rug. But most impressive of all was the white-haired master,
      regarding him with a thoughtful and searching, but kindly, glance. Bishop
      presently found a tongue with which to stammer out his mission,&mdash;he
      would be a pupil of the great Gérôme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled, and, bidding his model retire, inspected carefully the
      array of drawings that Bishop spread at his feet,&mdash;Gérôme must have
      evidence of some ability for the magic of his brain and touch to develop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Sont pas mal, mon ami</i>," he said, after he had studied all the
      drawings; "<i>non, pas mal</i>." Bishop's heart bounded,&mdash;his work
      was not bad! "<i>Vous êtes Américain?</i>" continued the master. "<i>C'est
      un pays que j'aimerais bien visiter si le temps ne me manquait pas</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he chatted on, putting Bishop more and more at his ease. He talked of
      America and the promising future that she has for art; then he went into
      his little office, and, asking Bishop's name, filled out the blank that
      made him a happy pupil of Gérôme. He handed it to Bishop with this
      parting-advice, spoken with great earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Il faut travailler, mon ami&mdash;travailler! Pour arriver, travailler
      toujours, sérieusement, bien entendu!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was so proud and happy that he ran all the way up the six flights
      of stairs to our floor, burst into the studio, and executed a war-dance
      that would have shamed an Apache, stepping into his paint-box and nearly
      destroying his sacred Unknown. That night we had a glorious supper, with
      des escargots to start with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the fifteenth of October, with his head erect and hope filling
      his soul, Bishop started for the Beaux-Arts, which was in the Rue
      Bonaparte, quite near. That night he returned wise and saddened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had bought a new easel and two rush-bottomed tabourets, which every new
      student must provide, and, loaded with these, he made for the Ecole.
      Gathered at the big gates was a great crowd of models of all sorts, men,
      women, and children, fat, lean, and of all possible sizes. In the court-
      yard, behind the gates, was a mob of long-haired students, who had a year
      or more ago passed the initiatory ordeal and become ancients. Their
      business now was to yell chaff at the arriving nouveaux. The concierge
      conducted Bishop up-stairs to the Administration, where he joined a long
      line of other nouveaux waiting for the opening of the office at ten
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he produced his papers and was enrolled as a student of the Ecole.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only in this government school of the four arts that the typical
      Bohemian students of Paris may be found, including the genuine type of
      French student, with his long hair, his whiskers, his Latin Quarter "plug"
      hat, his cape, blouse, wide corduroy trousers, sash, expansive necktie,
      and immense cane. The Ecole preserves this type more effectually than the
      other schools, such as Julian's and Colarossi's, where most of the
      students are foreigners in conventional dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the others who entered Gérôme's atelier at the same time that Bishop
      did was a Turk named Haidor (fresh from the Ottoman capital), a Hungarian,
      a Siamese, an American from the plains of Nebraska, and five Frenchmen
      from the provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all tried to speak French and be agreeable as they entered the
      atelier together. At the door stood a gardien, whose principal business is
      to mark absentees and suppress riots. Then they passed to the gentle
      mercies of the reception committee and the <i>massier</i> within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>massier</i> is a student who manages the studio, models, and <i>masse</i>
      money. This one, a large fellow with golden whiskers (size and strength
      are valuable elements of the massier's efficiency), demanded twenty-five
      francs from each of the new-comers,&mdash;this being the <i>masse</i>
      money, to pay for fixtures, turpentine, soap, and clean towels, <i>et pour
      payer à boire</i>. The Turk refused to pay, protesting that he had but
      thirty francs to last him the month; but menacing stools and sticks opened
      his purse; his punishment was to come later. After the money had been
      collected from all the nouveaux the entire atelier of over sixty students,
      dressed in working blouses and old coats, formed in line, and with
      deafening shouts of "<i>A boire! à boire!</i>" placed the <i>nouveaux</i>
      in front to carry the class banner, and thus marched out into the <i>Rue
      Bonaparte</i> to the <i>Café des Deux Magots</i>, singing songs fit only
      for the studio. Their singing, shouting, and ridiculous capers drew a
      great crowd. At the café they created consternation with their shouting
      and howling until the arrival of great bowls of "<i>grog Américain</i>,"
      cigarettes, and <i>gâteaux</i>. Rousing cheers were given to a
      marriage-party across the Place St.-Germain. The Turk was forced to do a
      Turkish dance on a table and sing Turkish songs, and to submit to
      merciless ridicule. The timid little Siamese also had to do a turn, as did
      Bishop and W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the American from Nebraska, who had
      been a cowboy at home. After yelling themselves hoarse and nearly wrecking
      the café, the students marched back in a disorderly mob to the Ecole. Then
      the real trouble began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardien having conveniently disappeared, the students closed and
      barricaded the door. "<i>A poil! à poil!</i>" they yelled, dancing
      frantically about the frightened nouveaux; "<i>à poil les sales nouveaux!
      à poil!</i>" They seized the Turk and stripped him, despite his desperate
      resistance; then they tied his hands behind him and with paint and brushes
      decorated his body in the most fantastic designs that they could conceive.
      His oaths were frightful. He cursed them in the name of Allah, and swore
      to have the blood of all Frenchmen for desecrating the sacred person of a
      Moslem. He called them dogs of infidels and Christians. But all this was
      in Turkish, and the students enjoyed it immensely. "<i>En broche!</i>"
      they yelled, after they had made him a spectacle with the brushes; "<i>en
      broche! Il faut le mettre en broche!</i>" This was quickly done. They
      forced the Turk to his haunches, bound his wrists in front of his upraised
      knees, thrust a long pole between his elbows and knees, and thus bore him
      round the atelier at the head of a singing procession. Four times they
      went round; then they placed the helpless M. Haidor on the model-stand for
      future reference. The bad French that the victim occasionally mixed with
      his tirade indicated the fearful damnation that he was doubtless dealing
      out in Turkish.
    </p>
    <p>
      A circle was then formed about him, and a solemn silence fell upon the
      crowd. A Frenchman named Joncierge, head of the reception committee,
      stepped forth, and in slow and impressive speech announced that it was one
      of the requirements of the Atelier Gérôme to brand all nouveaux over the
      heart with the name of the atelier, and that the branding of the Turk
      would now proceed. Upon hearing this, M. Haidor emitted a fearful howl.
      But he was turned to face the red-hot studio stove and watch the
      branding-iron slowly redden in the coals. During this interval the
      students sang the national song, and followed it with a funeral march.
      Behind the Turk's back a second poker was being painted to resemble a
      red-hot one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot poker was taken from the fire, and its usefulness tested by
      burning a string with it. Haidor grew deathly pale. An intense silence sat
      upon the atelier as the iron was brought near the helpless young man. In a
      moment, with wonderful cleverness, the painted poker was substituted for
      the hot one and placed quickly against his breast. When the cold iron
      touched him he roared like a maddened bull, and rolled quivering and
      moaning upon the floor. The students were frantic with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Haidor could realize that he was not burned to a
      crisp. He was then taken across the atelier and hoisted to a narrow shelf
      fifteen feet from the floor, where he was left to compose himself and
      enjoy the tortures of the other nouveaux. He dared not move, however, lest
      he fall; and because he refused to take anything in good- nature, but
      glared hatred and vengeance down at them, they pelted him at intervals
      with water-soaked sponges.
    </p>

      The Hungarian and one of the French nouveaux were next seized and
      stripped. Then they were ordered to fight a duel, in this fashion: they
      were made to mount two stools about four feet apart. The Hungarian was
      handed a long paint-brush dripping with Prussian blue, and the Frenchman a
      similar brush soaked with crimson lake. Then the battle began. Each
      hesitated to splash the other at first, but as they warmed to their work
      under the shouting of the committee they went in with a will. When the
      Frenchman had received a broad splash on the mouth in return for a chest
      decoration of his adversary, his blood rose, and then the serious work
      began.

      Both quickly lost their temper. When they were unwillingly made to desist
      the product of their labors was startling, though not beautiful. Then they
      were rubbed down vigorously with turpentine and soiled towels, and were
      given a franc each for a bath, because they had behaved so handsomely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop came next. He had made up his mind to stand the initiation
      philosophically, whatever it might be, but when he was ordered to strip he
      became apprehensive and then angry. Nothing so delights the students as
      for a <i>nouveau</i> to lose his temper. Bishop squared off to face the
      whole atelier, and looked ugly. The students silently deployed on three
      sides, and with a yell rushed in, but not before three of them had gone
      down under his fists did they pin him to the floor and strip him. While
      Bishop was thus being prepared, the Nebraskan was being dealt with. He had
      the wisdom not to lose his temper, and that made his resistance all the
      more formidable. Laughing all the time, he nevertheless dodged, tripped,
      wrestled, threw stools, and did so many other astonishing and baffling
      things that the students, though able to have conquered him in the end,
      were glad to make terms with him. In this arrangement he compelled them to
      include Bishop. As a result, those two mounted the model throne naked, and
      sang together and danced a jig, all so cleverly that the Frenchmen were
      frantic with delight, and welcomed them as <i>des bons amis</i>. The
      amazing readiness and capability of the American fist bring endless
      delight and perennial surprise to the French.

      The rest of the nouveaux were variously treated. Some, after being
      stripped, were grotesquely decorated with designs and pictures not
      suitable for general inspection. Others were made to sing, to recite, or
      to act scenes from familiar plays, or, in default of that, to improvise
      scenes, some of which were exceedingly funny. Others, attached to a rope
      depending from the ceiling, were swung at a perilous rate across the
      atelier, dodging easels in their flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past twelve the sport was over. The barricade was removed, the
      Turk's clothes hidden, the Turk left howling on his shelf, and the atelier
      abandoned. The next morning there was trouble. The director was furious,
      and threatened to close the atelier for a month, because the Turk had not
      been discovered until five o'clock, when his hoarse howls attracted the
      attention of the gardien of the fires. His trousers and one shoe could not
      be found. It was three months before Haidor appeared at the atelier again,
      and then everything had been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was made miserable during the ensuing week. He would find himself
      roasting over paper fires kindled under his stool. Paint was smeared upon
      his easel to stain his hands. His painting was altered and entirely
      re-designed in his absence. Strong-smelling cheeses were placed in the
      lining of his "plug" hat. His stool-legs were so loosened that when he sat
      down he struck the floor with a crash. His painting-blouse was richly
      decorated inside and out with shocking coats of arms that would not wash
      out. One day he discovered that he had been painting for a whole hour with
      currant jelly from a tube that he thought contained laque.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, being a <i>nouveau</i>, he could never get a good position in which
      to draw from the model. Every Monday morning a new model is posed for the
      week, and the students select places according to the length of time they
      have been attending. The nouveaux have to take what is left. And they must
      be servants to the ancients,&mdash;run out for tobacco, get soap and clean
      towels, clean paint-brushes, and keep the studio in order. With the
      sculptors and architects it is worse. The sculptors must sweep the dirty,
      clay-grimed floor regularly, fetch clean water, mix the clay and keep it
      fresh and moist, and on Saturdays, when the week's work is finished, must
      break up the forty or more clay figures, and restore them to clay for next
      week's operations. The architects must build heavy wooden frames, mount
      the projects and drawings, and cart them about Paris to the different
      exhibition rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a year the <i>nouveau</i> drops his hated title and becomes
      a proud ancient, to bully to his heart's content, as those before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mondays and Wednesdays are criticism days, for then M. Gérôme comes down
      and goes over the work of his pupils. He is very early and punctual, never
      arriving later than half-past eight, usually before half the students are
      awake. The moment he enters all noises cease, and all seem desperately
      hard at work, although a moment before the place may have been in an
      uproar. Gérôme plumps down upon the man nearest to him, and then visits
      each of his <i>élèves</i>, storming and scolding mercilessly when his
      pupils have failed to follow his instructions. As soon as a student's
      criticism is finished he rises and follows the master to hear the other
      criticisms, so that toward the close the procession is large.

      Bishop's first criticism took him all aback. "<i>Comment!</i>" gasped the
      master, gazing at the canvas in horror. "<i>Qu'est-ce que vous avez fait?</i>"
      he sternly demanded, glaring at the luckless student, who, in order to
      cultivate a striking individuality, was painting the model in broad, thick
      dashes of color. Gérôme glanced at Bishop's palette, and saw a complete
      absence of black upon it. "<i>Comment, vous n'avez pas de noir?</i>" he
      roared. "<i>C'est très important, la partie matérielle! Vous ne m'écoutez
      pas, mon ami,&mdash;-je parle dans le désert! Vous n'avez pas d'aspect
      général, mon ami,</i>" and much more, while Bishop sat cold to the marrow.
      The students, crowded about, enjoyed his discomfiture immensely, and,
      behind Gérôme's back, laughed in their sleeves and made faces at Bishop.
      But many others suffered, and Bishop had his inning with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All during Gérôme's tour of inspection the model must maintain his pose,
      however difficult and exhausting. Often he is kept on a fearful strain for
      two hours. After the criticism the boys show Gérôme sketches and studies
      that they have made outside the Ecole, and it is in discussing them that
      his geniality and kindliness appear. Gérôme imperiously demands two
      things,&mdash;that his pupils, before starting to paint, lay on a red or
      yellow tone, and that they keep their brushes scrupulously clean. Woe to
      him who disobeys!
    </p>
    <p>
      After he leaves with a cheery "<i>Bon jour, messieurs!</i>" pandemonium
      breaks loose, if the day be Saturday. Easels, stools, and studies are
      mowed down as by a whirlwind, yells shake the building, the model is
      released, a tattoo is beaten on the sheet-iron stove-guard, everything
      else capable of making a noise is brought into service, and either the
      model is made to do the <i>danse du ventre</i> or a <i>nouveau</i> is
      hazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The models&mdash;what stories are there! Every Monday morning from ten to
      twenty present themselves, male and female, for inspection in <i>puris
      naturalibus</i> before the critical gaze of the students of the different
      ateliers. One after another they mount the throne and assume such academic
      poses of their own choosing as they imagine will display their points to
      the best advantage. The students then vote upon them, for and against, by
      raising the hand. The massier, standing beside the model, announces the
      result, and, if the vote is favorable, enrols the model for a certain week
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is intense rivalry among the models. Strange to say, most of the
      male models in the schools of Paris are from Italy, the southern part
      especially. As a rule, they have very good figures. They begin posing at
      the age of five or six, and follow the business until old age retires
      them. Crowds of them are at the gates of the Beaux-Arts early on Monday
      mornings. In the voting, a child may be preferred to his seniors, and yet
      the rate of payment is the same,&mdash;thirty francs a week.

      Many of the older models are quite proud of their profession, spending
      idle hours in studying the attitudes of figures in great paintings and in
      sculptures in the Louvre or the Luxembourg, and adopting these poses when
      exhibiting themselves to artists; but the trick is worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few of the women models remain long in the profession. Posing is hard and
      fatiguing work, and the students are merciless in their criticisms of any
      defects of figure that the models may have,&mdash;the French are born
      critics. During the many years that I have studied and worked in Paris I
      have seen scores of models begin their profession with a serious
      determination to make it their life-work.

      They would appear regularly at the different ateliers for about two years,
      and would be gratified to observe endless reproductions of their graces in
      the prize rows on the studio walls. Then their appearance would be less
      and less regular, and they would finally disappear altogether&mdash;whither?
      Some become contented companions of students and artists, but the cafés
      along the <i>Boul' Mich'</i>, the cabarets of Montmartre, and the
      dance-halls of the Moulin Rouge and the Bal Bullier have their own story
      to tell. Some are happily married; for instance, one, noted for her beauty
      of face and figure, is the wife of a New York millionaire. But she was
      clever as well as beautiful, and few models are that. Most of them are
      ordinaire, living the easy life of Bohemian Paris, and having little
      knowledge of <i>le monde propre.</i> But, oh, how they all love dress! and
      therein lies most of the story. When Marcelle or Hélène appears, all of a
      sudden, radiant in silks and creamy lace petticoats, and sweeps proudly
      into the crowded studios, flushed and happy, and hears the dear
      compliments that the students heap upon her, we know that thirty francs a
      week could not have changed the gray grub into a gorgeous butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>C'est mon amant qui m'a fait cadeau,</i>" Marcelle will explain,
      deeming some explanation necessary. There is none to dispute you,
      Marcelle. This vast whirlpool has seized many another like you, and will
      seize many another more. And to poor Marcelle it seems so small a price to
      pay to become one of the grand ladies of Paris, with their dazzling jewels
      and rich clothes!
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd whim may overtake one here and there. One young demoiselle,
      beautiful as a girl and successful as a model a year ago, may now be seen
      nightly at the <i>Cabaret du Soleil d'Or</i>, frowsy and languishing, in
      keeping with the spirit of her confrères there, singing her famous "<i>Le
      Petit Caporal</i>" to thunderous applause, and happy with the love,
      squalor, dirt, and hunger that she finds with the luckless poet whose
      fortunes she shares. It was not a matter of clothes with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a short and easy step from the studio to the <i>café</i>. At the
      studio it is all little money, hard posing, dulness, and poor clothes; at
      the <i>cafés</i> are the brilliant lights, showy clothes, tinkling money,
      clinking glasses, popping corks, unrestrained abandon, and midnight
      suppers. And the studios and the <i>cafés</i> are but adjoining
      apartments, one may say, in the great house of Bohemia. The studio is the
      introduction to the <i>café</i>; the <i>café</i> is the burst of sunshine
      after the dreariness of the studio; and Marcelle determines that for once
      she will bask in the warmth and glow.... Ah, what a jolly night it was,
      and a louis d'or in her purse besides! Marcelle's face was pretty&mdash;and
      new. She is late at the studio next morning, and is sleepy and cross. The
      students grumble. The room is stifling, and its gray walls seem ready to
      crush her. It is so tiresome, so stupid&mdash;and only thirty francs a
      week! Bah!... Marcelle appears no more.

      All the great painters have their exclusive model or models, paying them a
      permanent salary. These favored ones move in a special circle, into which
      the ordinaire may not enter, unless she becomes the favorite of some grand
      homme. They are never seen at the academies, and rarely or never pose in
      the schools, unless it was there they began their career.

      Perhaps the most famous of the models of Paris was Sarah Brown, whose wild
      and exciting life has been the talk of the world. Her beautiful figure and
      glorious golden hair opened to her the whole field of modeldom. Offers for
      her services as model were more numerous than she could accept, and the
      prices that she received were very high. She was the mistress of one great
      painter after another, and she lived and reigned like a queen. Impulsive,
      headstrong, passionate, she would do the most reckless things. She would
      desert an artist in the middle of his masterpiece and come down to the
      studio to pose for the students at thirty francs a week. Gorgeously
      apparelled, she would glide into a studio, overturn all the easels that
      she could reach, and then shriek with laughter over the havoc and
      consternation that she had created. The students would greet her with
      shouts and form a circle about her, while she would banteringly call them
      her friends. Then she would jump upon the throne, dispossess the model
      there, and give a dance or make a speech, knocking off every hat that her
      parasol could reach. But no one could resist Sarah.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up to the <i>Atelier Gérôme</i> one morning and demanded une
      semaine de femme. The <i>massier</i> booked her for the following week.
      She arrived promptly on time and was posed. Wednesday a whim seized her to
      wear her plumed hat and silk stockings. "<i>C'est beaucoup plus chic</i>,"
      she naively explained. When Gérôme entered the studio and saw her posing
      thus she smiled saucily at him, but he turned in a rage and left the
      studio without a word. Thursday she tired of the pose and took one to
      please herself, donning a skirt. Of course protests were useless, so the
      students had to recommence their work. The remainder of the week she sat
      upon the throne in full costume, refusing to pose. She amused herself with
      smoking cigarettes and keeping the <i>nouveaux</i> running errands for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was she who was the cause of the students' riot in 1893,&mdash;a riot
      that came near ending in a revolution. It was all because she appeared at
      le Bal des Quat'z' Arts in a costume altogether too simple and natural to
      suit the prefect of police, who punished her. She was always at the Salon
      on receiving-day, and shocked the occupants of the liveried carriages on
      the Champs-Elysées with her dancing. In fact, she was always at the head
      of everything extraordinary and sensational among the Bohemians of Paris.
      But she aged rapidly under her wild life. Her figure lost its grace, her
      lovers deserted her, and after her dethronement as Queen of Bohemia,
      broken-hearted and poor, she put an end to her wretched life,&mdash;and
      Paris laughed.

      The breaking in of a new girl model is a joy that the students never
      permit themselves to miss. Among the many demoiselles who come every
      Monday morning are usually one or two that are new. The new one is
      accompanied by two or more of her girl friends, who give her encouragement
      at the terrible moment when she disrobes. As there are no dressing-rooms,
      there can be no privacy. The students gather about and watch the
      proceedings with great interest, and make whatever remarks their deviltry
      can suggest. This is the supreme test; all the efforts of the attendant
      girls are required to hold the new one to her purpose. When finally, after
      an inconceivable struggle with her shame, the girl plunges ahead in
      reckless haste to finish the job, the students applaud her roundly.

      But more torture awaits her. Frightened, trembling, blushing furiously,
      she ascends the throne, and innocently assumes the most awkward and
      ridiculous poses, forgetting in that terrible moment the poses that she
      had learned so well under the tutelage of her friends. It is then that the
      fiendishness of the students rises to its greatest height. Dazed and numb,
      she hardly comprehends the ordeal through which she is now put. The
      students have adopted a grave and serious bearing, and solemnly ask her to
      assume the most outlandish and ungraceful poses. Then come long and
      mock-earnest arguments about her figure, these arguments having been
      carefully learned and rehearsed beforehand. One claims that her waist is
      too long and her legs too heavy; another hotly takes the opposite view.
      Then they put her through the most absurd evolutions to prove their
      points. At last she is made to don her hat and stockings; and the students
      form a ring about her and dance and shout until she is ready to faint.

    <p>
      Of course the studio has a ringleader in all this deviltry,&mdash;all
      studios have. Joncierge is head of all the mischief in our atelier. There
      is no end to his ingenuity in devising new means of torture and fun. His
      personations are marvellous. When he imitates Bernhardt, Réjane, or Calvé,
      no work can be done in the studio. Gérôme himself is one of his favorite
      victims. But Joncierge cannot remain long in one school; the authorities
      pass him on as soon as they find that he is really hindering the work of
      the students. One day, at Julian's, he took the class skeleton, and with a
      cord let the rattling, quivering thing down into the Rue du Dragon, and
      frightened the passers out of their wits. As his father is chef
      d'orchestre at the Grand Opéra, Joncierge junior learns all the operas and
      convulses us with imitations of the singers.

      Another character in the studio is le jeune Siffert, only twenty-three,
      and one of the cleverest of the coming French painters. Recently he nearly
      won the Prix de Rome. His specialty is the imitation of the cries of
      domestic fowls and animals, and of street venders. Gérôme calls him "mon
      fils," and constantly implores him to be serious. I don't see why.

      Then there is Fiola, a young giant from Brittany, with a wonderful

      sing one verse of a Brittany chant, driving the other students mad.

      Fournier is a little curly-headed fellow from the south, near Valence, and
      wears corduroy trousers tucked into top-boots. His greatest delight is in
      plaguing the nouveaux. His favorite joke, if the day is dark, is to send a
      nouveau to the different ateliers of the Ecole in search of "le grand
      réflecteur." The nouveau, thinking that it is a device for increasing the
      light, starts out bravely, and presently returns with a large, heavy box,
      which, upon its being opened, is found to be filled with bricks. Then
      Fournier is happy.

      Taton is the butt of the atelier. He is an ingénu, and falls into any trap

      Haidor, the Turk, suspicious and sullen, also is a butt. Caricatures of
      him abundantly adorn the walls, together with the Turkish crescent, and
      Turkish ladies executing the <i>danse du ventre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caricatures of all kinds cover the walls of the atelier, and some are
      magnificent, being spared the vandalism that spares nothing else. One,
      especially good, represents Kenyon Cox, who studied here.

      W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the student from Nebraska, created a sensation by
      appearing one day in the full regalia of a cowboy, including two immense
      revolvers, a knife, and a lariat depending from his belt. With the lariat
      he astonished and dismayed the dodging Frenchmen by lassoing them at will,
      though they exercised their greatest running and dodging agility to
      escape. They wanted to know if all Americans went about thus heeled in
      America.

      There is something uncanny about the little Siamese. He is exceedingly
      quiet and works unceasingly. One day, when the common spirit of mischief
      was unusually strong among the boys, the bolder ones began to hint at fun
      in the direction of the Siamese. He quietly shifted a pair of brass
      knuckles from some pocket to a more convenient one, and although it was
      done so unostentatiously, the act was observed. He was not disturbed, and
      has been left strictly alone ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the Italian students took the whole atelier down to a little
      restaurant on the Quai des Grands-Augustins and cooked them an excellent
      Italian dinner, with Chianti to wash it down. Two Italian street-singers
      furnished the music, and Mademoiselle la Modèle danced as only a model
      can.

      TAKING PICTURES TO THE SALON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VER since New
      Year's, when Bishop began his great composition for the Salon, our life at
      the studio had been sadly disarranged; for Bishop had so completely buried
      himself in his work that I was compelled to combine the functions of cook
      with those of chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0021" id="linkimage-0021"> </a>

    <p>
      This double work, with increasing pressure from my modelling, required
      longer hours at night and shorter hours in the morning. But I was
      satisfied, for this was to be Bishop's masterpiece, and I knew from the
      marvellous labor and spirit that he put into the work that something good
      would result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of his great effort was "The Suicide." It was like him to choose
      so grisly a subject, for he had a lawless nature and rebelled against the
      commonplace. Ghastly subjects had always fascinated him. From the very
      beginning of our domestic partnership he had shown a taste for grim and
      forbidding things. Often, upon returning home, I had found him making
      sketches of armless beggars, twisted cripples, and hunchbacks, and, worse
      than all, disease-marked vagabonds. A skull-faced mortal in the last
      stages of consumption was a joy to him. It was useless for me to protest
      that he was failing to find the best in him by developing his unwholesome
      tastes. "Wait," he would answer patiently; "the thing that has suffering
      and character, that is out of the ordinary, it is the thing that will
      strike and live."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suicide was a young woman gowned in black; she was poised in the act
      of plunging into the Seine; a babe was tightly clutched to her breast; and
      behind the unspeakable anguish in her eyes was a hungry hope, a veiled
      assurance of the peace to come. It fascinated and haunted me beyond all
      expression. It was infinitely sad, tragic, and terrible, for it reached
      with a sure touch to the very lowest depth of human agony. The scene was
      the dead of night, and only the dark towers of Notre-Dame broke the even
      blackness of the sky, save for a faint glow that touched the lower
      stretches from the distant lamps of the city. In the darkness only the
      face of the suicide was illuminated, and that but dimly, though
      sufficiently to disclose the wonderfully complex emotions that crowded
      upon her soul. This illumination came from three ghastly green lights on
      the water below. The whole tone of the picture was a black, sombre green.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all after the painting had been finished. The making of it is a
      story by itself. From the first week in January to the first week in March
      the studio was a junk-shop of the most uncanny sort. In order to pose his
      model in the act of plunging into the river, Bishop had rigged up a
      tackle, which, depending from the ceiling, caught the model at the waist,
      after the manner of a fire-escape belt, and thus half suspended her. He
      secured his green tone and night effect by covering nearly all the
      skylight and the window with green tissue-paper, besides covering the
      floor and walls with green rugs and draperies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model behaved very well in her unusual pose, but the babe&mdash;that
      was the rub. The model did not happen to possess one, and Bishop had not
      yet learned the difficulties attending the procuring and posing of
      infants. In the first place, he found scores of babes, but not a mother,
      however poor, willing to permit her babe to be used as a model, and a
      model for so gruesome a situation. But after he had almost begun to
      despair, and had well advanced with his woman model, an Italian woman came
      one day and informed him that she could get an infant from a friend of her
      sister's, if he would pay her one franc a day for the use of it. Bishop
      eagerly made the bargain. Then a new series of troubles began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The babe objected most emphatically to the arrangement. It refused to
      nestle in the arms of a strange woman about to plunge into eternity, and
      the strange woman had no knack at all in soothing the infant's outraged
      feelings. Besides, the model was unable to meet the youngster's frequent
      demands for what it was accustomed to have, and the mother, who was
      engaged elsewhere, had to be drummed up at exasperatingly frequent
      intervals. All this told upon both Bishop and Francinette, the model, and
      they took turns in swearing at the unruly brat, Bishop in English and
      Francinette in French. Neither knew how to swear in Italian, or things
      might have been different. I happened in upon these scenes once in a
      while, and my enjoyment so exasperated Bishop that he threw paint- tubes,
      bottles, and everything else at me that he could reach, and once or twice
      locked me out of the studio, compelling me to kick my shins in the cold
      street for hours at a time. On such occasions I would stand in the court
      looking up at our window, expecting momentarily that the babe would come
      flying down from that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bishop was not sketching and painting he was working up his
      inspiration; and that was worst of all. His great effort was to get
      himself into a suicidal mood. He would sit for hours on the floor, his
      face between his knees, imagining all sorts of wrongs and slights that the
      heartless world had put upon him. His husband had beaten him and gone off
      with another woman; he had tried with all his woman-heart to bear the
      cross; hunger came to pinch and torture him; he sought work, failed to
      find it; sought charity, failed to find that; his babe clutched at his
      empty breasts and cried piteously for food; his heart broken, all hope
      gone, even God forgetting him, he thought of the dark, silent river, the
      great cold river, that has brought everlasting peace to countless
      thousands of suffering young mothers like him; he went to the river; he
      looked back upon the faint glow of the city's lights in the distance; he
      cast his glance up to the grim towers of Notre-Dame, standing cold and
      pitiless against the blacker sky; he looked down upon the black Seine, the
      great writhing python, so willing to swallow him up; he clutched his babe
      to his breast, gasped a prayer....
    </p>
    <p>
      At other times he would haunt the Morgue and study the faces of those who
      had died by felo-de-se; he would visit the hospitals and study the dying;
      he would watch the actions and read the disordered thoughts of lunatics;
      he would steal along the banks; of the river on dark nights and study the
      silent mystery and tragedy of it, and the lights that gave shape to its
      terrors. In the end I grew afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all things have an end. Bishop's great work was finished in the first
      days of March. Slowly, but surely, his native exuberance of spirits
      returned. He would eat and sleep like a rational being. His eyes lost
      their haunted look, and his cheeks filled out and again took on their
      healthy hue. And then he invited his friends and some critics to inspect
      his composition, and gave a great supper in celebration of the completion
      of his task. Very generous praise was given him. Among the critics and
      masters came Gérôme and Laurens at his earnest supplication, and it was
      good to see their delight and surprise, and to note that they had no fault
      to find,&mdash;was not the picture finished, and would not criticism from
      them at this juncture have hurt the boy without accomplishing any good?
      Well, the painting secured honorable mention in the exhibition, and five
      years later the French government completed the artist's happiness by
      buying one of his pictures for the Luxembourg Gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But about the picture: the canvas was eight by ten feet, and a frame had
      to be procured for it. Now, frames are expensive, and Bishop had
      impoverished himself for material and model hire. So he employed a
      carpenter in the court to make a frame of thick pine boards, which we
      painted a deep black, with a gold cornice. The whole cost was twenty- five
      francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day we hired a good-sized <i>voiture-à-bras</i> at eight sous an
      hour, and proceeded to get the tableau down to the court. It was a
      devilish job, for the ceilings were low and the stairs narrow and crooked.
      The old gentleman below us was nearly decapitated by poking his head out
      of his door at an inopportune moment, and the lady below him almost wiped
      the still wet babe from the canvas with her gown as she tried to squeeze
      past. The entire court turned out to wish Bishop good success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day on which pictures are admitted to the Salon, there to await
      the merciless decision of the judges, is a memorable one. In sumptuous
      studios, in wretched garrets; amid affluence, amid scenes of squalor and
      hunger, artists of all kinds and degrees have been squeezing thousands of
      tubes and daubing thousands of canvases in preparation for the great day.
      From every corner of Paris, from every quarter of France and Europe, the
      canvases come pouring into the Salon. Every conceivable idea, fad, and
      folly is represented in the collection, and most of them are poor; but in
      each and every one a fond hope centres, an ambition is staked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange as it may seem, most of these pictures are worked upon until the
      very last day; indeed, many of them are snatched unfinished from their
      easels, to receive the finishing touches in the dust and confusion and
      deafening noise of the great hall where they are all dumped like so much
      merchandise. We saw one artist who, not having finished his picture, was
      putting on the final touches as it was borne ahead of him along the street
      on the back of a commissionnaire.
    </p>

    <p>
      And all this accounts for the endless smearing everywhere noticeable, and
      for the frantic endeavors of the artists to repair the damage at the last
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One great obstacle to poor artists is the rigid rule requiring that all
      tableaux shall be framed. These frames are costly. As a result, some
      artists paint pictures of the same size year after year, so that the same
      frame may be used for all, and others resort to such makeshifts as Bishop
      was compelled to employ. But these makeshifts must be artistically done,
      or the canvases are ignored by the judges. These efforts give rise to many
      startling effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not very long, after an easy pull over the Boulevard St.-Germain,
      before we crossed the Seine at the Pont de la Concorde, traversed the
      Place de la Concorde, and turned into the Champs-Elysées, where, not far
      away, loomed the Palais des Beaux-Arts, in which the Salon is annually
      held in March. The Avenue des Champs-Elysées, crowded as it usually is in
      the afternoons, was now jammed with cabs, omnibuses, hand-carts, and all
      sorts of moving vans, mingling with the fashionable carriages on their way
      to the Bois. The proletarian vehicles contained art,&mdash;art by the ton.
      The upper decks of the omnibuses were crowded with artists carrying their
      pictures because they could not afford more than the three-sous fare. And
      such an assortment of artists!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some in affluent circumstances, who rolled along voluptuously
      in cabs on an expenditure of thirty-five francs, holding their precious
      tableaux and luxuriantly smoking cigarettes.

      The commissionnaires had a great day of it. They are the ones usually seen
      asleep on the street corners, where, when awake, they varnish boots or
      bear loads by means of a contrivance on their backs. On this day every one
      of them in Paris was loaded down with pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the hard-up students, like Bishop, tugging hand-carts, or
      pairing to carry by hand pictures too large to be borne by a single
      person. And great fun they got out of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the Palais de Glace was a perfect sea of vehicles, artists,
      porters, and policemen, all inextricably tangled up, all shouting or
      groaning, and wet pictures suffering. One artist nearly had a fit when he
      saw a full moon wiped off his beautiful landscape, and he would have
      killed the guilty porter had not the students interfered. Portraits of
      handsome ladies with smudged noses and smeared eyes were common. Expensive
      gold frames lost large sections of their corners. But still they were
      pouring in.
    </p>
    <p>
      With infinite patience and skill Bishop gradually worked his <i>voiture-à-
      bras</i> through the maze, and soon his masterpiece was in the crushing
      mass at the wide entrance to the Salon. There it was seized and rushed
      along, and Bishop received in return a slip of paper bearing a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      While within the building we reconnoitred. Amid the confusion of howling
      inspectors, straining porters bearing heavy pictures, carpenters erecting
      partitions, and a dust-laden atmosphere, numerous artists were working
      with furious haste upon their unfinished productions. Some were perched
      upon ladders, others squatted upon the floor, and one had his model posing
      nude to the waist; she was indifferent to the attention that she received.
      Thoughtful mistresses stood affectionately beside their artist amants,
      furnishing them with delicate edibles and lighting cigarettes for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the pictures were so large that they were brought in rolled up.
      One artist had made himself into a carpenter to mount his mammoth picture.
      Frightful and impossible paintings were numerous, but the painter of each
      expected a <i>première médaille d'honneur</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing six o'clock, the closing hour. Chic demoiselle artistes
      came dashing up in cabs, bringing with them, to insure safe delivery,
      their everlasting still-life subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly before six the work in the building was suspended by a commotion
      outside. It was a contingent of students from the Beaux-Arts marching up
      the Champs-Elysées, yelling and dancing like maniacs and shaking their
      heavy sticks, the irresistible Sarah Brown leading as drum-maior. She was
      gorgeously arrayed in the most costly silks and laces, and looked a
      dashing Amazon. Then, as always, she was perfectly happy with her beloved
      <i>étudiants</i>, who worshipped her as a goddess. She halted them in
      front of the building, where they formed a circle round her, and there, as
      director of ceremonies, she required them to sing chansons, dance, make
      comic speeches, and "blaguer" the arriving artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last van was unloaded; the great doors closed with a bang, and the
      stirring day was ended. All the students, even the porters, then joined
      hands and went singing, howling, and skipping down the Champs-Elysées, and
      wishing one another success at the coming exhibition. At the Place de la
      Concorde we met a wild-eyed artist running frantically toward the Salon
      with his belated picture. The howls of encouragement that greeted him lent
      swifter wings to his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pictures finally installed, a jury composed of France's greatest
      masters pass upon them. The endless procession of paintings is passed
      before them; the raising of their hands means approval, silence means
      condemnation; and upon those simple acts depends the happiness or despair
      of thousands. But depression does not long persist, and the judgment is
      generally accepted in the end as just and valuable. For the students, in
      great part, flock to the country on sketching tours, for which
      arrangements had been already made; and there the most deeply depressed
      spirits must revive and the habit of work and hope come into play. Year
      after year the same artists strive for recognition at the Salon; and
      finally, when they fail at that, they reflect that there is a great world
      outside of the Salon, where conscientious effort is acceptable. And, after
      all, a medal at the Salon is not the only reward that life has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, it is not always good for a student to be successful from the
      start. Just as his social environment in Paris tries his strength and
      determines the presence or absence of qualities that are as useful to a
      successful career as special artistic qualifications, so the trial by fire
      in the Salon exhibitions hardens and toughens him for the serious work of
      his life ahead. Too early success has ruined more artists than it has
      helped. It is interesting also to observe that, as a rule, the students
      who eventually secure the highest places in art are those whose
      difficulties have been greatest. The lad with the pluck to live on a crust
      in a garret, and work and study under conditions of poverty and
      self-denial that would break any but the stoutest heart, is the one from
      whom to expect renown in the years to come. Ah, old Paris is the harshest
      but wisest of mothers!
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>H! ah! vive les Quat'z' Arts! Au Molin Rouge&mdash;en route!</i>" the
      lamplit streets of Paris as cab after cab and bus after 'bus went
      thundering across town toward Montmartre, heavily freighted with
      brilliantly costumed revellers of les Quat'z' Arts. Parisians ran from
      their dinner- tables to the windows and balconies, blasé boulevardiers
      paused in their evening stroll or looked up from their papers at the <i>café</i>-tables,
      waiters and swearing cabbies and yelling newsboys stopped in the midst of
      their various duties, and all knowingly shook their heads, "<i>Ah, ce sont
      les Quat'z' Arts!</i>"?
    </p>
    <p>
      For to-night was the great annual ball of the artists, when all artistic
      Paris crawls from its mysterious depths to revel in a splendid carnival
      possible only to the arts. Every spring, after the pictures have been sent
      to the Salon, and before the students have scattered for the summer
      vacation, the artists of Paris and the members of all the ateliers of the
      four arts&mdash;painting, sculpture, architecture, and engraving&mdash;combine
      their forces in producing a spectacle of regal splendor, seen nowhere else
      in the world; and long are the weeks and hard the work and vast the
      ingenuity devoted to preparations,&mdash;the designing of costumes and the
      building of gorgeous floats.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last three weeks the <i>élèves</i> of the <i>Atelier Gérôme</i>
      abandoned their studies, forgot all about the concours and the Prix de
      Rome, and devoted all their energies to the construction of a colossal
      figure of Gérôme's great war goddess, "Bel-lona." It was a huge task, but
      the students worked it out with a will. Yards of sackcloth, rags, old
      coats, paint rags, besides pine timbers, broken easels and stools, endless
      wire and rope, went into the making of the goddess's frame, and this was
      covered with plaster of Paris dexterously moulded into shape. Then it was
      properly tinted and painted and mounted on a chariot of gold. A Grecian
      frieze of galloping horses, mounted, the clever work of Siffert, was
      emblazoned on the sides of the chariot. And what a wreck the atelier was
      after all was finished! <i>Sacré nom d'un chien!</i> How the gardiens must
      have sworn when cleaning-day came round!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ateliers in the Ecole are all rivals, and each had been secretly
      preparing its coup with which to capture the grand prix at the bal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great day came at last. The students of our atelier were perfectly
      satisfied with their handiwork, and the massier made all happy by ordering
      a retreat to the Café des Deux Magots, where success to the goddess was
      drunk in steaming "grog Américain." Then Bellona began her perilous
      journey across Paris to Montmartre and the Moulin Rouge.

    <p>
      This was not an easy task, as she was fifteen feet high; signs and lamp-
      posts suffered, and sleepy cab-horses danced as their terrified gaze
      beheld the giant goddess with her uplifted sword. Crowds watched the
      progress of Bellona on the Avenue de l'Opéra, drawn by half a hundred
      students yelling the national hymn. The pull up the steep slope of
      Montmartre was heavy, but in less than two hours from the start at the
      Ecole the goddess was safely housed in the depths of the Moulin Rouge,
      there to await her triumphs of the night.

      Bishop, besides doing his share in the preparation of the figure, had the
      equally serious task of devising a costume for his own use at the ball. It
      was not until the very last day that he made his final decision,&mdash;to
      go as a Roman orator. Our supply of linen was meagre, but our only two
      clean bed-sheets and a few towels were sufficient, and two kind American
      ladies who were studying music and who lived near the old church of St.
      Sulpice did the fitting of a toga. The soles of a pair of slippers from
      which Bishop cut the tops served as sandals, and some studio properties in
      the way of Oriental bracelets completed his costume. I was transformed
      into an Apache Indian by a generous rubbing into my skin of burnt sienna
      and cadmium, which I was weeks in getting rid of; a blanket and some
      chicken-feathers finished my array. Our friend Cameron, next door, went in
      his Scotch kilts. After supper we entered the Boul' Mich' and proceeded to
      the Café de la Source, where the students of the <i>Atelier Gérôme</i>
      were to rendezvous.

      The Boul' was a spectacle that night. Time had rolled back the curtain of
      centuries; ancient cemeteries had yielded up their dead; and living ghosts
      of the ages packed all the gay <i>café</i>s. History from the time of Adam
      had sent forth its traditions, and Eves rubbed elbows with ballet- girls.
      There was never a jollier night in the history of the Quartier Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the Café de la Source already crowded by the Gérôme contingent
      and their models and mistresses, all en costume and bubbling with
      merriment and mischief. It was ten o'clock before all the students had
      arrived. Then we formed in procession, and yelled and danced past all the
      <i>café</i>s on the Boul' Mich' to the Luxembourg Palace and the Théâtre
      de l'Odéon, to take the 'buses of the Montmartre line. These we quickly
      seized and overloaded in violation of the law, and then, dashing down the
      quiet streets of the Rive Gauche, headed for Montmartre, making a noise to
      rouse the dead. As we neared the Place Blanche we found the little streets
      merging from different quarters crowded with people in costume, some
      walking and others crowding almost innumerable vehicles, and the balconies
      and portes-cochères packed with spectators. The Place Blanche fronts the
      Moulin Rouge, and it was crowded and brilliantly lighted. The façade of
      the Moulin Rouge was a blaze of electric lights and colored lanterns, and
      the revolving wings of the mill flamed across the sky. It was a perfect
      night. The stars shone, the air was warm and pleasant, and the trees were
      tipped with the glistening clean foliage of early spring. The bright <i>café</i>s
      fronting the Place were crowded with gay revellers. The poets of Bohemia
      were there, and gayly attired cocottes assisted them in their fun at the
      <i>café</i> tables, extending far out into the boulevard under the trees.
      At one corner was Gérôme's private studio, high up in the top of the
      house, and standing on the balcony was Gérôme himself, enjoying the
      brilliant scene below.

      As the Bal des Quat'z' Arts is not open to the public, and as none but
      accredited members of the four arts are admitted, the greatest precautions
      are taken to prevent the intrusion of outsiders; and wonderful is the
      ingenuity exercised to outwit the authorities. Inside the vestibule of the
      Moulin was erected a tribune (a long bar), behind which sat the massiers
      of the different studios of Paris, all in striking costumes. It was their
      task not only to identify the holders of tickets, but also to pass on the
      suitability of the costumes of such as were otherwise eligible to
      admittance. The costumes must all have conspicuous merit and be thoroughly
      artistic. Nothing black, no dominos, none in civilian dress, may pass.
      Many and loud were the protestations that rang through the vestibule as
      one after another was turned back and firmly conducted to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once past the implacable tribunes, we entered a dazzling fairy-land, a
      dream of rich color and reckless abandon. From gorgeous kings and queens
      to wild savages, all were there; courtiers in silk, naked gladiators,
      nymphs with paint for clothing,&mdash;all were there; and the air was
      heavy with the perfume of roses. Shouts, laughter, the silvery clinking of
      glasses, a whirling mass of life and color, a bewildering kaleidoscope, a
      maze of tangled visions in the soft yellow haze that filled the vast hall.
      There was no thought of the hardness and sordidness of life, no dream of
      the morrow. It was a wonderful witchery that sat upon every soul there.
    </p>
    <p>
      This splendid picture was framed by a wall of lodges, each sumptuously
      decorated and hung with banners, tableaux, and greens, each representing a
      particular atelier and adorned in harmony with the dominant ideals of
      their masters. The lodge of the <i>Atelier Gérôme</i> was arranged to
      represent a Grecian temple; all the decorations and accessories were pure
      Grecian, cleverly imitated by the master's devoted pupils. That of the
      Atelier Cormon repre sented a huge caravan of the prehistoric big- muscled
      men that appeal so strongly to Cormon; large skeletons of extinct animals,
      giant ferns, skins, and stone implements were scattered about, while the
      students of Cormon's atelier, almost naked, with bushy hair and clothed in
      skins, completed the picture. And so it was with all the lodges, each
      typifying a special subject, and carrying it out with perfect fidelity to
      the minutest detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event of the evening was the grand cortège; this, scheduled for one
      o'clock, was awaited with eager expectancy, for with it would come the
      test of supremacy,&mdash;the awarding of the prize for the best. For this
      was the great art centre of the world, and this night was the one in which
      its rivalries would strain the farthest reach of skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the great hall swarmed with life and blazed with color and
      echoed with the din of merry voices. Friends recognized one another with
      great difficulty. And there was Gérôme himself at last, gaudily gowned in
      the rich green costume of a Chinese mandarin, his white moustache dyed
      black, and his white locks hidden beneath a black skull-cap topped with a
      bobbing appendage. And there also was Jean Paul Laurens, in the costume of
      a Norman, the younger Laurens as Charlemagne. Léandre, the caricaturist,
      was irresistible as a caricature of Queen Victoria. Puech, the sculptor,
      made a graceful courtier of the Marie Antoinette régime. Willett was a
      Roman emperor. Will Dodge was loaded with the crown, silks, and jewels of
      a Byzantine emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Loeb was a desperate Tartar bandit. Castaigne made a hit as an
      Italian jurist. Steinlen, Grasset, Forain, Rodin,&mdash;in fact, nearly
      all the renowned painters, sculptors, and illustrators of Paris were
      there; and besides them were the countless students and models.

      "La cavalcade! le grand cortège!" rose the cry above the crashing of the
      band and the noise of the revellers; and then all the dancing stopped.
      Emerging from the gardens through the open glass door, bringing with it a
      pleasant blast of the cool night air, was the vanguard of the great
      procession. The orchestra struck up the "Victor's March," and a great cry
      of welcome rang out.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came a band of yelling Indians dancing in, waving their spears and
      tomahawks, and so cleaving a way for the parade. A great roar filled the
      glass-domed hall when the first float appeared. It was daring and unique,
      but a masterpiece. Borne upon the shoulders of Indians, who were naked but
      for skins about their loins, their bodies stained a dark brown and striped
      with paint, was a gorgeous bed of fresh flowers and trailing vines; and
      reclining in this bed were four of the models of Paris, lying on their
      backs, head to head, their legs upraised to support a circular tablet of
      gold.

      Upon this, high in air, proud and superb, was the great Susanne in all her
      peerless beauty of face and form,&mdash;simply that and nothing more. A
      sparkling crown of jewels glowed in her reddish golden hair; a flashing
      girdle of electric lights encircled her slender waist, bringing out the
      marvellous whiteness of her skin, and with delicate shadows and tones
      modelling the superb contour of her figure. She looked a goddess&mdash;and
      knew it. The crowd upon whom she looked down stood for a while spell-
      bound, and then, with a waving of arms and flags, came a great shout,
      "Susanne! Susanne! la belle Susanne!" Susanne only smiled. Was she not the
      queen of the models of Paris?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Bellona! Gérôme, when he conceived and executed the idea
      embodied in this wonderful figure, concentrated his efforts to produce a
      most terrifying, fear-inspiring image typifying the horrors of war. The
      straining goddess, poised upon her toes to her full height, her face
      uplifted, her head thrust forward, with staring eyes and screaming mouth,
      her short two-edged sword in position for a sweeping blow, her glittering
      round shield and her coat of mail, a huge angry python darting its tongue
      and raising its green length from the folds of her drapery,&mdash;all this
      terrible figure, reproduced with marvellous fidelity and magnified
      tenfold, overwhelmed the thousands upon whom it glowered. Surrounding the
      golden chariot was a guard of Roman and Greek gladiators, emperors,
      warriors, and statesmen. From the staring eyes of Bellona flashed green
      fire, whose uncanny shafts pierced the yellow haze of the ball-room. Under
      a storm of cheers Bellona went on her way past the tribune of the judges.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0097.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Following Bellona came a beautiful reproduction of Gérôme's classical
      "Tanagra," which adorns the sculpture gallery of the Luxembourg. The
      figure was charmingly personated by Marcelle, a lithe, slim, graceful
      model of immature years, who was a rage in the studios. Gérôme himself
      applauded the grace of her pose as she swept past his point of vantage in
      the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0029" id="linkimage-0029"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Behind Tanagra came W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, also of the Atelier Gérôme,
      dressed as an Apache warrior and mounted on a bucking broncho. He was an
      American, from Nebraska, where he was a cowboy before he became famous as
      a sculptor. He received a rousing welcome from his fellow-artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Atelier Cormon came next,&mdash;a magnificent lot of brawny fellows
      clothed in skins, and bearing an immense litter made of tree branches
      bound with thongs and weighted down with strong naked women and children
      of a prehistoric age. It was a reproduction of Cormon's masterpiece in the
      Luxembourg Gallery, and was one of the most impressive compositions in the
      whole parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the works of the many other studios, all strong and effective,
      but none so fine as the three first. The Atelier Pascal, of architecture,
      made a sensation by appearing as Egyptian mummies, each mummy dragging an
      Egyptian coffin covered with ancient inscriptions and characters and
      containing a Parisian model, all too alive and sensuous to personate the
      ancient dead. Another atelier strove hard for the prize with eggs of
      heroic size, from which as many girls, as chicks, were breaking their way
      to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the grand cortège had paraded the hall several times it disbanded,
      and the ball proceeded with renewed enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tribune, wherein the wise judges sat, was a large and artistic affair,
      built up before the gallery of the orchestra and flanked by broad steps
      leading to its summit. It was topped with the imperial escutcheon of Rome&mdash;battle-axes
      bound in fagots&mdash;and bore the legend, "<i>Mort aux Tyrants</i>," in
      bold letters. Beneath was a row of ghastly, bloody severed heads,&mdash;those
      of dead tyrants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The variety and originality of the costumes were bewildering. One
      Frenchman went as a tombstone, his back, representing a headstone,
      containing a suitable inscription and bearing wreaths of immortelles and
      colored beads. Another, from the Atelier Bon-nat, went simply as a stink,
      nothing more, nothing less, but it was potent. He had saturated his skin
      with the juice of onions and garlic, and there was never any mistaking his
      proximity. Many were the gay Bacchantes wearing merely a bunch of grapes
      in their hair and a grape-leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      At intervals during the evening the crowd would suddenly gather and form a
      large circle, many deep, some climbing upon the backs of others the better
      to see, those in front squatting or lying upon the floor to accommodate
      the mass behind them. The formation of these circles was the signal for
      the <i>danse du ventre</i>.*
    </p>
    <p>
      * The danse du ventre (literally, belly-dance) is of Turkish origin, and
      was introduced to Paris by Turkish women from Egypt. Afterward these women
      exhibited it in the Midway Plaisance of the Columbian Exposition, Chicago,
      and then at the California Midwinter Exposition, San Francisco. As danced
      by Turkish women it consists of astonishing control and movements of the
      abdominal and chest muscles (hence its other name, muscle-dance), varied
      with more or less graceful steps and gyrations, with adjuncts, such as
      castanets, scarfs, etc., and the seemingly perilous use of swords. Such
      clothing is worn as least obscures the play of the muscles. It is danced
      to a particular Turkish air, monotonously repeated by an orchestra of male
      Turkish musicians, with Turkish instruments, and the dance is done solus.
      A dance closely analogous to it, though of a wholly independent origin, is
      the hula-hula of the Hawaiian women; but the hula-hula lacks the grace,
      dash, and abandon of the Turkish dance. The danse du ventre, as danced by
      French and American women who have "picked it up," is very different from
      that of the Turkish women&mdash;different both in form and meaning.
      Whatever of suggestiveness it may be supposed to carry is, in the
      adaptation, grossly exaggerated, and whatever of grace and special
      muscular skill, evidently acquired by Turkish women only from long and
      thorough drill, is eliminated. W. C. M.

      The name of some favorite model would be yelled, and the orchestra would
      strike up the familiar Oriental strain. And there was always a model to
      respond. Then the regular dancing would be resumed until another circle
      was formed and another favorite goddess of the four arts would be called
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o'clock when supper was announced by the appearance of two
      hundred white-aproned waiters carrying scores of tables, chairs, and
      hampers of plate and glassware. The guests fell to with a will and
      assisted in spreading and setting the tables; almost in a moment the vast
      hall was a field of snow pricked out with the brilliant costumes of the
      revellers. Then came a frightful din of pounding on the tables for the
      supper. Again marched in the two hundred waiters, loaded with cases of
      champagne, plates of creamy soup, roasts, salads, cheeses, creams, cakes,
      ices,&mdash;a feast of Bacchus, indeed. The banquet was enjoyed with
      Bohemian abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twelve wise judges of the Tribune now gravely announced their award of
      prizes, and each announcement was received with ringing applause. The <i>Atelier
      Gérôme</i> received first prize,&mdash;fifty bottles of champagne, which
      were immediately taken possession of. The other ateliers received smaller
      prizes, as their merits deserved, and all were satisfied and happy. The
      banquet was resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now here was Susanne, not content with her triumph of the early evening,
      springing upon one of the central tables, sending the crockery and
      glassware crashing to the floor with her dainty foot, and serenely
      surveying the crowd as it greeted her tumultuously, and, seizing a bottle
      of champagne, sending its foaming contents over as wide a circle of
      revellers as her strength could reach, laughing in pure glee over her
      feat, and then bathing her own white body with the contents of another
      bottle that she poured over herself. A superb Bacchante she made! A
      general salute of popping corks and clinking glasses greeted her, and she
      acknowledged the compliment with the danse du ventre. Susanne was so sure
      of the adoration and affection of the ateliers! Her dance was a challenge
      to every other model in the chamber. One after another, and often several
      at a time, they mounted the tables, spurned the crockery to the floor, and
      gave the danse du ventre. The Moulin was indeed a wild scene of joyous
      abandonment, and from an artistic point of view grand, a luminous point in
      the history of modern times. Here were the life, the color, the grace of
      the living picture, with a noble background of surrounding temples,
      altars, statues,&mdash;a wonderful spectacle, that artists can understand
      and appreciate.

      The feast wore merrily through the small hours until the cold blue dawn
      began to pale the lights in the ceiling. Strangely beautiful was this
      color effect, as the blue stole downward through the thick yellow glamour
      of the hall, quickening the merry-makers with a new and uncanny light,
      putting them out of place, and warning them thence. But still the ball
      went rolling on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the floor was slippery with wine and dangerous from broken glass,
      dancing and the cutting of capers proceeded without abatement. The
      favorite danse du ventre and songs and speeches filled the night to the
      end of the ball, and then the big orchestra, with a great flourish, played
      the "Victor's March." This was the signal for the final procession. The
      vast concourse of students and artists poured forth into the cool, sweet
      morning air, and the bal was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris was asleep, that early April morning, save for the street-sweepers
      and the milkmaids and the concierges. But the Place Blanche was very much
      awake. The morning air was new wine in stale veins, and it banished
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>En cavalcade! en cavalcade!</i>" was the cry; and in cavalcade it was.
      A great procession of all the costumers was formed, to march ensemble
      across Paris to the Quartier Latin. Even the proud Bellona was dragged
      along in the rear, towering as high as the lower wings of the now
      motionless red windmill. She seemed to partake in the revelry, for she
      swayed and staggered in an alarming fashion as she plunged recklessly down
      the steeps of Montmartre.

      The deserted Rue Blanche re-echoed the wild yells and songs of the
      revellers and the rattling of the string of cabs in the rear. The rows of
      heaped ash-cans that lined the way were overturned one after another, and
      the oaths and threatening brooms of the outraged concierges went for
      nothing. Even the poor diligent rag- and bone-pickers were not spared;
      their filled sacks, carrying the result of their whole night's hunt, were
      taken from them and emptied. A string of carts heavily laden with stone
      was captured near the Rue Lafayette, the drivers deposed, and the big
      horses sent plunging through Paris, driven by Roman charioteers, and
      making more noise than a company of artillery.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Place de l'Opéra was reached a thousand revellers swarmed up the
      broad stairs of the Grand Opéra like colored ants, climbed upon the
      lamp-posts and candelabra, and clustered all over the groups of statuary
      adorning the magnificent façade. The band took up a position in the centre
      and played furiously, while the artists danced ring-around-a- rosy, to the
      amazement of the drowsy residents of the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalcade then re-formed and marched down the Avenue de l'Opéra toward
      the Louvre, where it encountered a large squad of street-sweepers washing
      the avenue. In an instant the squad had been routed, and the revellers,
      taking the hose and brooms, fell to and cleaned an entire block, making it
      shine as it had never shone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabs were captured, the drivers decorated with Roman helmets and swords,
      and dances executed on the tops of the vehicles. One character, with
      enormous india-rubber shoes, took delight in permitting cabs to run over
      his feet, while he emitted howls of agony that turned the hair of the
      drivers white.

      As the immense cavalcade filed through the narrow arches of the Louvre
      court-yard it looked like a mediaeval army returning to its citadel after
      a victorious campaign; the hundreds of battle-flags, spears, and
      battle-axes were given a fine setting by the noble architecture of the
      Pavillon de Rohan. Within the court of the Louvre was drawn up a regiment
      of the Garde Municipale, going through the morning drill; and they looked
      quite formidable with their evolutions and bayonet charges. But when the
      mob of Greek and Roman warriors flung themselves bodily upon the ranks of
      the guard, ousted the officers, and assumed command, there was
      consternation.

    <p>
      All the rigid military dignity of the scene disappeared, and the drill was
      turned into such a farce as the old Louvre had never seen before. The
      officers, furious at first, could not resist the spirit of pure fun that
      filled the mob, and took their revenge by kissing the models and making
      them dance. The girls had already done their share of the conquering by
      pinning flowers to military coats and coyly putting pretty lips where they
      were in danger. Even the tall electric-light masts in the court were
      scaled by adventurous students, who attached brilliant flags, banners, and
      crests to the mast-heads far above the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the unspeakable relief of the officers, the march was then resumed. The
      Pont du Carrousel was the next object of assault; here was performed the
      solemn ceremony of the annual sacrifice of the Quat'z' Arts to the river
      Seine. The mighty Bellona was the sacrifice. She was trundled to the
      centre of the bridge and drawn close to the parapet, while the disciples
      of the four arts gathered about with uncovered heads. The first bright
      flashes of the morning sun, sweeping over the towers of Notre-Dame, tipped
      Bellona's upraised sword with flame. The band played a funeral march.
      Prayers were said, and the national hymn was sung; then Bellona was sent
      tottering and crashing over the parapet, and with a mighty plunge she sank
      beneath the waters of the Seine. A vast shout rang through the crisp
      morning air. Far below, poor Bellona rose in stately despair, and then
      slowly sank forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parade formed again and proceeded to the Beaux-Arts, the last point of
      attack. Up the narrow Rue Bonaparte went singing the tired procession; the
      gates of the Ecole opened to admit it, cabs and all, and the doors were
      shut again. Then in the historic court-yard of the government school,
      surrounded by remnants of the beautiful architecture of once stately
      chateaux and palaces, and encircled by graceful Corinthian columns, the
      students gave a repetition of the grand ball at the Moulin Rouge. A
      strange and incongruous sight it was in the brilliant sunshine, and the
      neighboring windows and balconies were packed with onlookers. But by
      halfpast seven every trace of the Bal des Quat'z' Arts had disappeared,&mdash;the
      great procession had melted away to the haunts of Bohemia.

      proper name for the great thoroughfare of the Quartier Latin is the
      Boulevard Saint-Michel, but the boulevardiers call it the Boul' Mich',
      just as the students call the Quatre Arts the Quat'z' Arts, because it is

      The Boul' Mich' is the student's highway to relaxation. Mention of it at
      once recalls whirling visions of brilliant <i>café</i>s, with their
      clattering of saucers and glasses, the shouting of their white-aproned
      garçons, their hordes of gay and wicked damsels dressed in the costliest
      and most fashionable gowns, and a multitude of riotous students howling
      class songs and dancing and parading to the different <i>café</i>s as only
      students can. This is the head-quarters of the Bohemians of real Bohemia,
      whose poets haunt the dim and quaint cabarets and read their compositions
      to admiring friends; of flower-girls who offer you un petit bouquet,
      seulement dix centimes, and pin it into your button-hole before you can
      refuse; of Turks in picturesque native costume selling sweetmeats; of the
      cane man loaded down with immense sticks; of the stems a yard long; of
      beggars, gutter-snipes, hot-chestnut venders, ped- lers, singers, actors,
      students, and all manner of queer characters.

      The life of the Boul' Mich' begins at the Panthéon, where repose the
      remains of France's great men, and ends at the Seine, where the gray
      Gothic towers and the gargoyles of Notre-Dame look down disdainfully upon
      the giddy traffic below. The eastern side of the Boul' is lined with <i>café</i>s,
      cabarets, and brasseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is historic ground, for where now is the old Hôtel Cluny are still to
      be seen the ruins of Roman baths, and not a great distance hence are the
      partly uncovered ruins of a Roman arena, with its tiers of stone seats and
      its dens. The tomb of Cardinal Richelieu is in the beautiful old chapel of
      the Sorbonne, within sound of the wickedest <i>café</i> in Paris, the Café
      d'Harcourt.

      In the immediate vicinity are to be found the quaint jumbled buildings of
      old Paris, but they are fast disappearing. And the Quartier abounds in the
      world's greatest schools and colleges of the arts and sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was often our wont on Saturday evenings to saunter along the Boul', and
      sometimes to visit the <i>café</i>s. To Bishop particularly it was always
      a revelation and a delight, and he was forever studying and sketching the
      types that he found there. He was intimately acquainted in all the <i>café</i>s
      along the line, and with the mysterious rendezvous in the dark and narrow
      side streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      American beverages are to be had at many of the <i>café</i>s on the Boul',&mdash;a
      recent and very successful experiment. The idea has captured the fancy of
      the Parisians, so that "<i>Bars Américains</i>," which furnish cocktails
      and sours, are numerous in the <i>café</i>s. Imagine a Parisian serenely
      sucking a manhattan through a straw, and standing up at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boul' Mich' is at its glory on Saturday nights, for the students have
      done their week's work, and the morrow is Sunday. Nearly everybody goes to
      the Bal Bullier. This is separated from the crowded Boul' Mich' by several
      squares of respectable dwelling-houses and shops, and a dearth of <i>café</i>s
      prevails thereabout. At the upper end of the Luxembourg is a long stone
      wall brilliantly bedecked with lamps set in clusters,&mdash;the same wall
      against which Maréchal Ney was shot (a striking monument across the way
      recalls the incident). At one end of this yellow wall is an arched entrée,
      resplendent with the glow of many rows of electric lights and lamps, which
      reveal the colored bas-reliefs of dancing students and gri-settes that
      adorn the portal. Near by stands a row of voitures, and others are
      continually dashing up and depositing Latin-Quarter swells with hair
      parted behind and combed forward toward the ears, and dazzling visions of
      the demi-monde in lace, silks, and gauze. And there is a constantly
      arriving stream of students and gaudily dressed women on foot. Big gardes
      municipaux stand at the door like stone images as the crowd surges past.

      To-night is one-franc night. An accommodating lady at the box-office hands
      us each a broad card, and another, au vestiaire, takes our coats and hats
      and charges us fifty centimes for the honor. Descending the broad flight
      of softly carpeted red stairs, a brilliant, tumultuous, roaring vision
      bursts upon us, for it is between the dances, and the visitors are
      laughing and talking and drinking. The ball-room opens into a generous
      garden filled with trees and shrubbery ingeniously devised to assure many
      a secluded nook, and steaming garçons are flying hither and thither
      serving foaming bocks and colored syrups to nymphs in bicycle bloomers,
      longhaired students under tam o'shanters, and the swells peculiar to le
      Quartier Latin.

    <p>
      "<i>Ah, mon ange!</i>" and other affectionate greetings made Bishop start
      guiltily, and then he discovered Hélène and Marcelle, two saucy little
      models who had posed at the École. There also was Fannie, formerly (before
      she drifted to the <i>café</i>s) our blanchisseuse, leaning heavily upon
      the arm of son amant, who, a butcher-boy during the day, was now arrayed
      in a cutaway coat and other things to match, including a red cravat that
      Fannie herself had tied; but he wore no cuffs. Many other acquaintances
      presented themselves to Bishop, somewhat to his embarrassment. One, quite
      a swell member of the demi-monde, for a moment deserted her infatuated
      companion, a gigantic Martinique negro, gorgeously apparelled, and ran up
      to tease Bishop to paint her portrait à l'oil, and also to engage him for
      la prochaine valse.

      The musicians were now playing a schottische, but large circles would be
      formed here and there in the hall, where clever exhibitions of fancy
      dancing would be given by students and by fashionably gowned damsels with
      a penchant for displaying their lingerie and hosiery. The front of the
      band-stand was the favorite place for this. Here four dashing young women
      were raising a whirlwind of lingerie and slippers, while the crowd
      applauded and tossed sous at their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to us stood a fat, cheery-faced little man, bearing the unmistakable
      stamp of an American tourist. His hands were in his pockets, his silk hat
      was tipped back, and his beaming red face and bulging eyes showed the
      intensity of his enjoyment. Without the slightest warning the slippered
      foot of one of these dancers found his shining tile and sent it bounding
      across the floor. For a moment the American was dazed by the suddenness
      and unearthly neatness of the feat; then he emitted a whoop of wonder and
      admiration, and in English exclaimed,&mdash;"You gol-darned bunch of
      French skirts&mdash;say, you're all right, you are, Marie! Bet you can't
      do it again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He confided to Bishop that his name was Pugson and that he was from
      Cincinnati.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," he exclaimed, joyously, "Paris is the top of the earth! You artists
      are an enviable lot, living over here all the time and painting&mdash;
      Gad! look at her!" and he was pushing his way through the crowd to get a
      better view of an uncommonly startling dancer, who was at the moment an
      indeterminate fluffy bunch of skirts, linen, and hosiery. Ah, what tales
      he will tell of Paris when he returns to Cincinnati, and how he will be
      accused of exaggerating!
    </p>
    <p>
      The four girls forming the centre of attraction were now doing all manner
      of astonishing things possible only to Parisian feminine anatomy. In
      another circle near by was Johnson, the American architect, stirring
      enthusiastic applause as he hopped about, Indian fashion, with a little
      brunette whose face was hidden in the shadow of her immense hat, her hair
      en bandeau, à la de Mérode. Could this really be the quiet Johnson of the
      Ecole, who but a week ago had been showing his mother and charming sister
      over Paris? And there, too, was his close friend, Walden, of Michigan,
      leading a heavy blonde to the dance! There were others whom we knew. The
      little Siamese was flirting desperately with a vision in white standing
      near his friend, a Japanese, who, in turn, was listening to the cooing of
      a clinging bloomer girl. Even Haidor, the Turk, was there, but he was
      alone in the gallery. Many sober fellows whom I had met at the studio were
      there, but they were sober now only in the sense that they were not drunk.
      And there were law students, too, in velveteen caps and jackets, and
      students in the sciences, and students in music, and négligé poets,
      littérateurs, and artists, and every model and cocotte who could furnish
      her back sufficiently well to pass the censorship of the severe critic at
      the door. If she be attractively dressed, she may enter free; if not, she
      may not enter at all.

      The gayety increased as the hours lengthened; the dancing was livelier,
      the shouting was more vociferous, skirts swirled more freely, and thin
      glasses fell crashing to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasanter out in the cool garden, for it was dreadfully hard to
      keep from dancing inside. The soft gleam of the colored lamps and lanterns
      was soothing, and the music was softened down to an echo. The broken rays
      of the lanterns embedded in the foliage laid bright patterns on the showy
      silks of the women, and the garçons made no noise as they flitted swiftly
      through the mazes of shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one end of the garden, surrounded by an hilarious group, were four
      wooden rocking-horses worked on springs. 'Astride of two of these were an
      army officer and his companion, a bloomer girl, who persistently twisted
      her ankles round her horse's head. The two others were ridden by a poet
      and a jauntily attired gri-sette. The four were as gleeful as children.

      We are back in the ball-room again,&mdash;it is hard to keep out. The
      gayety is at its height, the Bal Bullier is in full swing. The tables are
      piled high with saucers, and the garçons are bringing more. The room is
      warm and suffocating, the dancing and flirting faster than ever. Now and

      comes in its way!

      Our genial, generous new friend from Cincinnati was living the most
      glorious hour of his life. He had not been satisfied until he found and
      captured the saucy little wretch who had sent his hat spinning across the
      room; so now she was anchored to him, and he was giving exhibitions of
      American grace and agility that would have amazed his friends at home. For
      obviously he was a person of consequence there. When he saw us his face
      beamed with triumph, and he proudly introduced us to his
      mignonette-scented conquest, Mad-dem-mo-zel Madeleine (which he pronounced
      Madelyne), "the queen of the Latin Quarter. But blamed if I can talk the
      blooming lingo!" he exclaimed, ruefully. "You translate for me, won't
      you?" he appealed to Bishop, and Bishop complied. In paying compliments
      thus transmitted to Madeleine he displayed an adeptness that likely would
      have astounded his good spouse, who at that moment was slumbering in a
      respectable part of Paris.

      clothes are of the finest and most showy material; they wear shining silk
      hats, white waistcoats, white "spats," patent leathers, and very light kid
      gloves, not to mention a load of massive jewelry. The girls flutter about

      At exactly a quarter-past midnight the band played the last piece, the

      Out into the boulevard surged the heated crowd, shouting, singing, and
      cutting capers as they headed for the Boul' Mich', there to continue the
      revelries of which the Bal Bullier was only the beginning. "A la Taverne
      du Panthéon!" "Au Café Lorrain!" "Au Café d'Harcourt!" were the cries that
      range through the streets, mingled with the singing of half a thousand
      people.

      In this mob we again encountered our American acquaintance with his prize,
      and as he was bent on seeing all that he could of Paris, he begged us to
      see him through, explaining that money was no object with him, though
      delicately adding that our friends must make so many calls upon our
      hospitality as to prove a burden at times. He had only two days more in
      Paris, and the hours were precious, and "we will do things up in style,"
      he declared buoyantly. He did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop's arm was securely held by a little lassie all in soft creamy
      silks. She spoke Engleesh, and demurely asked Bishop if "we will go to ze
      <i>café</i> ensemble, n'est-ce-pas?" and Bishop had not the heart to eject
      her from the party. And so five of us went skipping along with the rest,
      Mr. Pugson swearing by all the gods that Paris was the top of the earth!
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the lower end of the Jardin du Luxembourg, at the old
      Palais, the bright glow of the <i>café</i>s, with their warm stained
      windows and lighthearted throngs, stretched away before us. Ah, le Boul'
      Mich' never sleeps! There are still the laughing grisettes, the singing
      and dancing students, the kiosks all aglow; the marchand de marrons is
      roasting his chestnuts over a charcoal brazier, sending out a savory
      aroma; the swarthy Turk is offering his wares with a princely grace; the
      flower-girls flit about with freshly cut carnations, violets, and Maréchal
      Niel roses,&mdash;"This joli bouquet for your sweetheart," they plead so
      plaintively; the pipe man plies his trade; the cane man mobs us, and the
      sellers of the last editions of the papers cry their wares.

      An old pedler works in and out among the <i>café</i> tables with a little
      basket of olives, deux pour un sou. The crawfish seller, with his little
      red écrevisses neatly arranged on a platter; Italian boys in white blouses
      bearing baskets filled with plaster casts of works of the old masters
      gewgaw pedlers,&mdash;they are still all busily at work, each adding his
      mite to the din.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>café</i>s are packed, both inside and out, but the favorite seats
      are those on the sidewalk under the awnings.

      We halted at the Café d'Harcourt. Here the crowd was thickest, the
      sidewalk a solid mass of humanity; and the noise and the waiters as they
      yelled their orders, they were there. And des femmes&mdash;how many! The
      Café d'Harcourt is the head-quarters of these wonderful creations of
      clothes, paint, wicked eyes, and graceful carriage. We worked our way into
      the interior. Here the crowd was almost as dense as without, but a chance
      offered us a vacant table; no sooner had we captured it than we were
      compelled to retreat, because of a battle that two excited demoiselles
      were having at an adjoining table. In another part of the room there was
      singing of "Les sergents sont des brave gens," and in the middle of the
      floor a petite cocotte, her hat rakishly pulled down over her eyes, was
      doing a dance very gracefully, her white legs gleaming above the short
      socks that she wore, and a shockingly high kick punctuating the
      performance at intervals.

      At other tables were seated students with their friends and mistresses,
      playing dominoes or recounting their petites histoires. One table drew
      much attention by reason of a contest in drinking between two seasoned
      habitués, one a Martinique negro and the other a delicate blond poet. The
      negro won, but that was only because his purse was the longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every consommation is served with a saucer, upon which is marked the price
      of the drink, and the score is thus footed à la fin de ces joies. There
      are some heavy accounts to be settled with the garçons.

      "<i>Ah! voilà Beeshop!" "Tiens! mon vieux!" "Comment vas-tu?</i>" clamored
      a half-dozen of Bishop's feminine acquaintances, as they surrounded our
      table, overwhelming us with their conflicting perfumes.

      These denizens of the Boul' have an easy way of making acquaintances, but
      they are so bright and mischievous withal that no offence can be taken;
      and they may have a stack of saucers to be paid for. Among the many <i>café</i>
      frequenters of this class fully half know a few words of English, Italian,
      German, and even Russian, and are so quick of perception that they can
      identify a foreigner at a glance. Consequently our table was instantly a
      target, principally on account of Mr. Pugson, whose nationality emanated
      from his every pore.

      "Ah, milord, how do you do? I spik Engleesh a few. Es eet not verra a
      beautiful night?" is what he got. "You are si charmant, monsieur!"
      protested another, stroking Bishop's Valasquez beard; and then, archly and
      coaxingly, "<i>Qu'est-ce que vous m'offrez, monsieur? Payez-moi un bock?</i>
      Yes?" Mr. Pugson made the garçons start. He ordered "everything and the
      best in the house" (in English); but it was the lordliness of his manner
      that told, as he leaned back in his chair and smoked his Londrès and eyed
      Madeleine with intense satisfaction. In the eyes of the beholders that
      action gave him the unmistakable stamp of an American millionaire. "Tell
      you, boys," he puffed, "I'm not going to forget Paree in a hurry." And
      Mademoiselle Madeleine, how she revelled! Mr. Pugson bought her everything
      that the venders had to sell, besides, for himself, a wretched plaster
      cast of a dancing-girl that he declared was "dead swell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take it home and startle the natives," he added; but he didn't, as
      we shall see later. Then he bought three big canes as souvenirs for
      friends, besides a bicycle lamp, a mammoth pipe, and other things. A
      hungry-looking sketch artist who presented himself was engaged on the spot
      to execute Mr. Pugson's portrait, which he made so flattering as to
      receive five francs instead of one, his price.

      At a neighboring table occupied by a group of students was Bi-Bi-dans-
      la-Purée, one of the most famous characters of the Quartier and
      Montmartre. With hilarious laughter the students were having fun with
      Bi-Bi by pouring the contents of their soup-plates and drinking-glasses
      down his back and upon his sparsely covered head; but what made them laugh
      more was Bi-Bi's wonderful skill in pulling grotesque faces. In that line
      he was an artist. His cavernous eyes and large, loose mouth did marvellous
      things, from the ridiculous to the terrible; and he could literally laugh
      from ear to ear. Poor Bi-Bi-dans-la-Purée!

      He had been a constant companion of the great Verlaine, but was that no
      more, since Verlaine had died and left him utterly alone. You may see him
      any day wandering aimlessly about the Quartier, wholly oblivious to the
      world about him, and dreaming doubtless of the great dead poet of the
      slums, who had loved him.

      Here comes old Madame Carrot, a weazened little hunchback, anywhere
      between sixty and a hundred years of age. She is nearly blind, and her
      tattered clothes hang in strips from her wreck of a form. A few thin
      strands of gray hair are all that cover her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bon soir, Mère Carrot! ma petite mignonne, viens donc qu'on
      t'embrasse! Où sont tes ailes?</i>" and other mocking jests greet her as
      she creeps among the tables. But Mère Carrot scorns to beg: she would earn
      her money. Look! With a shadowy remnant of grace she picks up the hem of
      her ragged skirt, and with a heart-breaking smile that discloses her
      toothless gums, she skips about in a dance that sends her audience into
      shrieks of laughter, and no end of sous are flung at her feet. She will
      sing, too, and caricature herself, and make pitiful attempts at high
      kicking and anything else that she is called upon to do for the sous that
      the students throw so recklessly. There are those who say that she is
      rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rear end of the <i>café</i> the demoiselle who had anchored herself
      to the Martinique negro at the Bal Bullier was on a table kicking the
      negro's hat, which he held at arm's length while he stood on a chair. "<i>Plus
      haut! plus haut encore!</i>" she cried; but each time, as he kept raising
      it, she tipped it with her dainty slipper; and then, with a magnificent
      bound, she dislodged with her toe one of the chandelier globes, which went
      crashing with a great noise to the floor; and then she plunged down and
      sought refuge in her adorer's arms.
    </p>

      The night's excitement has reached its height now. There is a dizzy whirl
      of skirts, feathers, "plug" hats, and silken stockings; and there is
      dancing on the tables, with a smashing of glass, while lumps of sugar
      soaked in cognac are thrown about. A single-file march round the room is
      started, each dragging a chair and all singing, "<i>Oh, la pauvre fille,
      elle est malade!</i>" Mr. Pugson, tightly clutching his canes and his
      Dancing-Girl, joins the procession, his shiny hat reposing on the pretty
      head of Mademoiselle Madeleine. But his heart almost breaks with regret
      because he cannot speak French.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to remonstrate with Bishop for his own unseemly levity, but the
      gloved hand of Mademoiselle Madeleine was laid on my lips, and her own red
      lips protested, "<i>Taisez-vous donc! c'est absolument inexcusable de nous
      faire des sermons en ce moment! En avant!</i>" And we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o'clock, and the <i>café</i>s were closing, under the municipal
      regulation to do so at that hour, and the Boul' was swarming with
      revellers turned out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the Rue Racine stands a small boulangerie, where some of
      the revellers were beating on the iron shutters and crying, "<i>Voilà du
      bon fromage au lait!</i>" impatient at the tardiness of the fat baker in
      opening his shop; for the odor of hot rolls and croissants came up through
      the iron gratings of the kitchen, and the big cans of fresh milk at the
      door gave further comforting assurances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lumbering slowly down the Boul' were ponderous carts piled high with
      vegetables, on their way to the great markets of Paris, the Halles
      Centrales. The drivers, half asleep on the top, were greeted with demands
      for transportation, and a lively bidding for passengers arose among them.
      They charged five sous a head, or as much more as they could get, and soon
      the carts were carrying as many passengers as could find a safe perch on
      the heaped vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Aux Halles! aux Halles! nous allons aux Halles! Oh, la, la, comme ils
      sont bons, les choux et les potirons!</i>" were the cries as the carts
      lumbered on toward the markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pugson had positively refused to accept our resignation, and stoutly
      reminded us of our promise to see him through. So our party arranged with
      a masculine woman in a man's coat on payment of a franc a head, and we
      clambered upon her neatly piled load of carrots. Mr. Pugson, becoming
      impatient at the slow progress of the big Normandy horses, began to pelt
      them with carrots. The market-woman protested vigorously at this waste of
      her property, and told Mr. Pugson that she would charge him two sous
      apiece for each subsequent carrot. He seized upon the bargain with true
      American readiness, and then flung carrots to his heart's content, the
      driver meanwhile keeping count in a loud and menacing voice. It was a new
      source of fun for the irrepressible and endlessly jovial American.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the now quiet boulevard the carts trundled in a string. All at once
      there burst from them all an eruption of song and laughter, which brought
      out numerous gendarmes from the shadows. But when they saw the crowd they
      said nothing but "<i>Les étudiants</i>," and retreated to the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were crossing the Pont-au-Change, opposite the Place du Châtelet,
      with its graceful column touched by the shimmering lights of the Seine,
      and dominated by the towers of Notre-Dame, Mr. Pugson, in trying to hurl
      two carrots at once, incautiously released his hold upon the Dancing-
      Girl, which incontinently rolled off the vegetables and was shattered into
      a thousand fragments on the pavement of the bridge&mdash;along with Mr.
      Pugson's heart. After a moment of silent misery he started to throw the
      whole load of carrots into the river, but he quickly regained command of
      himself. For the first time, however, his wonderful spirits were dampened,
      and he was as moody and cross as a child, refusing to be comforted even by
      Madeleine's cooing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of carts that we now encountered converging from many quarters
      warned us that we were very near the markets. Then rose the subdued noise
      that night-workers make. There seemed to be no end of the laden carts. The
      great Halles then came into view, with their cold glare of electric
      lights, and thousands of people moving about with baskets upon their
      backs, unloading the vegetable carts and piling the contents along the
      streets. The thoroughfares were literally walled and fortressed with
      carrots, cabbages, pumpkins, and the like, piled in neat rows as high as
      our heads for square after square. Is it possible for Paris to consume all
      of this in a day?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every few yards were fat women seated before steaming cans of hot potage
      and <i>café</i> noir, with rows of generous white bowls, which they would
      fill for a sou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not alone were the market workers here, for it seemed as though the Boul'
      Mich' had merely taken an adjournment after the law had closed its portals
      and turned it out of doors. The workers were silent and busy, but largely
      interspersed among them were the demi-mondaines and the singing and
      dancing students of the Quartier, all as full of life and deviltry as
      ever. It was with these tireless revellers that the soup- and coffee-women
      did their most thriving business, for fun brings a good appetite, and the
      soup and coffee were good; but better still was this unconventional,
      lawless, defiant way of taking them. Mr. Pugson's spirits regained their
      vivacity under the spell, and he was so enthusiastic that he wanted to buy
      out one of the pleasant-faced fat women; we had to drag him bodily away to
      avert the catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the side streets leading away from the markets are <i>café</i>s and
      restaurants almost without number, and they are open toute la nuit, to
      accommodate the market people, having a special permit to do so; but as
      they are open to all, the revellers from all parts of Paris assemble there
      after they have been turned out of the boulevard <i>café</i>s at two
      o'clock. It is not an uncommon thing early of a Sunday morning to see
      crowds of merry-makers from a bal masqué finishing the night here, all in
      costume, dancing and playing ring-around-a-rosy among the stacks of
      vegetables and the unheeding market people. Indeed, it is quite a common
      thing to end one's night's frivolity at the Halles and their <i>café</i>s,
      and take the first 'buses home in the early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contingent from the Boul' Mich', after assisting the market people to
      unload, and indulging in all sorts of pranks, invaded the élite <i>café</i>s,
      among them the <i>Café Barrette, Au Veau Qui Tête, Au Chien Qui Fume, and
      Le Caveau du Cercle.</i>

      At this last-named place, singing and recitations with music were in
      order, a small platform at one end of the room being reserved for the
      piano and the performers. Part of the audience were in masquerade costume,
      having come from a ball at Montmartre, and they lustily joined the
      choruses. Prices are gilt-edged here,&mdash;a franc a drink, and not less
      than ten sous to the garçon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between the fluffy and silk-gowned demi-mondaines and the
      dirty, roughly clad market people was very striking at the Café Barrette.
      There the women sit in graceful poses, or saunter about and give evidence
      of their style, silk gowns, India laces, and handsome furs, greeting each
      new-comer with pleas for a sandwich or a bock; they are always hungry and
      thirsty, but they get a commission on all sales that they promote. A small
      string orchestra gave lively music, and took up collections between
      performances. The array of gilt-framed mirrors heightened the brilliancy
      of the place, already sufficiently aglow with many electric lights. The
      Café Barrette is the last stand of the gaudy women of the boulevards. With
      the first gray gleam of dawn they pass with the night to which they
      belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with sincere feeling that Mr. Pugson bade us good-by at five
      o'clock that morning as he jumped into a cab to join his good spouse at
      the Hôtel Continental; but he bore triumphantly with him some sketches of
      the showy women at the Café Barrette, which Bishop had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Madeleine, so tremendously liberal had she found Mr. Pugson that
      her protestations of affection for him were voluble and earnest. She
      pressed her card upon him and made him swear that he would find her again.
      After we had bidden her good-night, Mr. Pugson drew the card from his
      pocket, and thoughtfully remarked, as he tore it to pieces,&mdash;"I don't
      think it is prudent to carry such things in your pocket."

      of having dinner at the studio, we saunter over to the Maison Dar-blay,
      passing the wall of the dismal Cimetière du Montparnasse on the way. The
      Maison Darblay is in the little Rue de la Gaieté, which, though only a
      block in length, is undoubtedly the liveliest thoroughfare in the
      Quartier. That is because it serves as a funnel between the Avenue du
      Maine and five streets that converge into it at the upper end.
      Particularly in the early evening the little street is crowded with people
      returning from their work. All sorts of boutiques are packed into this
      minute thoroughfare,&mdash;-jewelry-shops, pork-shops, kitchens (where
      they cook what you bring while you wait on the sidewalk), theatres, <i>cafés
      chantants</i>, fried-potato stalls, snail merchants, moving vegetable- and
      fruit-markets, and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the block, on the western side, between a millinery- shop
      and a butcher-shop, stands the Maison Darblay, famous for its beans and
      its patrons. A modest white front, curtained windows, and a row of
      milk-cans give little hint of the charms of the interior. Upon entering we
      encounter the vast M. Darblay seated behind a tiny counter, upon which are
      heaped a pile of freshly ironed napkins, parcels of chocolate, a big dish
      of apple-sauce, rows of bottles containing bitters that work miracles with
      ailing appetites, and the tip-box. Reflecting M. Darblay's beamy back and
      the clock on the opposite wall (which is always fifteen minutes fast)
      hangs a long mirror resplendent in heavy gilt frame; it is the pride of
      the establishment, and affords comfort to the actresses when they adjust
      their hats and veils upon leaving.

      M. Darblay is manager of the establishment, and when it is reflected that
      he weighs two hundred and sixty pounds, it may be imagined what accurate
      adjustments he has to make in fitting himself behind the small counter.
      When a boarder finishes his meal he goes to M. Darblay and tells him what
      he has had, including napkin and bread, and M. Darblay scores it all down
      on a slate with chalk and foots it up. After the bill is paid, the tip-box
      is supposed by a current fiction to receive two sous for Marie and
      Augustine, the buxom Breton maidens who serve the tables; but so rarely
      does the fiction materialize that, when the rattle of coins is heard in
      the box, the boarders all look up wonderingly to see the possible
      millionaire that has appeared among them, and Marie and Augustine shout at
      the top of their voices, "Merci bien, monsieur!"

      Lausanne, on Lake Geneva, Switzerland, and the independent blood of her
      race rarely fails its offices when M. Darblay incautiously seeks to
      interfere with her duties and prerogatives, for he retreats under an
      appalling volley of French from his otherwise genial spouse; on such
      occasions he seeks his own corner as rapidly as he can manage his bulk to
      that purpose. She is a famous cook. The memory of her poulets rôtis and
      juicy gigots will last forever. But greatest of all are her haricots
      blancs, cooked au beurre; it is at the shrine of her beans that her
      devoted followers worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her wonderful wisdom! She knows intuitively if you are out of sorts or
      have an uncertain appetite, and without a hint she will prepare a delicacy
      that no epicure could resist. She knows every little whim and peculiarity
      of her boarders, and caters to them accordingly. The steaks and chops are
      bought at the shop next door just when they are ordered, and are always
      fresh.

      There are eight marble-top tables lining the two walls, and each table is
      held sacred to its proper occupants, and likewise are the numbered hooks
      and napkins. An invasion of these preserves is a breech of etiquette
      intolerable in Bohemia.

      Situated as it is, in a group of three theatres and several <i>café</i>s
      chantants, it is the rendezvous of the actors and actresses of the
      neighborhood. They hold the three tables but one from the kitchen, on one
      side, and they are a jolly crowd, the actresses particularly.

      They are a part of the Quartier and echo its spirit. Although full of
      mischief and fun, the actresses would never be suspected of singing the
      naughty songs that so delight the gallery gods and so often wring a murmur
      of protest from the pit. There are ten who dine here, but from their
      incessant chatter and laughter you would think them twenty. On Friday
      evenings, when the songs and plays are changed, they rehearse their pieces
      at dinner.

      Bishop is openly fond of Mademoiselle Brunerye, a sparkling little
      brunette singer, who scolds him tragically for drawing horrible
      caricatures of her when he sits before the footlights to hear her sing.
      But it is always she that begins the trouble at the theatre. If Bishop is
      there, she is sure to see him and to interpolate something in her song
      about "<i>mon amant Américain</i>," and sing it pointedly at him, to the
      amusement of the audience and his great discomfiture; and so he retorts
      with the caricatures.

      Upon entering the restaurant the actresses remove their hats and wraps and

      His salary is a hundred francs a week; this makes the smaller actors look
      up to him, and enables him to wear a very long coat, besides gloves,
      patent-leather shoes, and a shiny top-hat. He occupies the place of honor,
      and Marie smiles when she serves him, and gives him a good measure of
      wine. He rewards this attention by depositing two sous in the tip-box
      every Friday night. Then there are M. Marius, M. Zecca, and M. Dufauj who
      make people scream with laughter at the Gaieté, and M. Coppée, the heavy
      villain of the terrible eyes in "Les Deux Gosses," and Mademoiselle Walzy,
      whose dark eyes sparkle mischief as she peeps over her glass, and
      Mademoiselle Minion, who kicks shockingly high to accentuate her songs,
      and eight other actresses just as saucy and pretty.

      The students of the Quartier practically take charge of the theatres on
      Saturday nights, and as they are very free with their expressions of
      approval or disapproval, the faces of the stage-people wear an anxious
      look at the restaurant on that evening. The students will throw the whole
      theatre into an uproar with hisses that drive an actor off the stage, or
      applause, recalls, and the throwing of two-sous bouquets and kisses to an
      actress who has made a hit.

      Promptly at six-forty-five every night the venerable M. Corneau enters
      Darblay's, bringing a copy of <i>Le Journal</i>. He is extremely
      methodical, so that any interruption of his established routine upsets him
      badly. One evening he found a stranger in his seat, occupying the
      identical chair that had been sacred to his use every evening for six
      years. M. Corneau was so astonished that he hung his hat on the wrong
      hook, stepped on the cat's tail, sulked in a corner, and refused to eat
      until his seat had been vacated, and then he looked as though he wished it
      could be fumigated. He has a very simple meal. One evening he invited me&mdash;a
      rare distinction&mdash;to his room, which was in the top floor of one of
      those quaint old buildings in the Rue du Moulin de Beurre. It could then
      be seen what a devoted scientist and student he was. His room was packed
      with books, chemicals, mineral specimens, and scientific instruments. He
      was very genial, and brewed excellent tea over an alcohol-stove of his own
      manufacture. Twenty years ago he was a professor at the Ecole des Mines,
      where he had served many years; but he had now grown too old for that, and
      was living his quiet, studious, laborious life on a meagre pension.

      At one table sit a sculptor, an artist, and a blind musician and his wife.
      The sculptor is slender, delicate, and nervous, and is continually rolling
      and smoking cigarettes. His blond hair falls in ringlets over his collar,
      and he looks more the poet than the sculptor, for he is dreamy and
      distrait, and seems to be looking within himself rather than upon the
      world about him. Augustine serves him with an absinthe Pernod au sucre,
      which he slowly sips while he smokes several cigarettes before he is ready
      for his dinner.

      The blind musician is a kindly old man with a benevolent face and a jovial
      spirit. He is the head professor of music at the Institution des Aveugles,
      on the Boulevard des Invalides. His wife is very attentive to him, taking
      his hat and cane, tucking his napkin under his chin, placing the dishes
      where he knows how to find them, and reading the papers to him. He knows
      where everybody sits, and he addresses each by name, and passes many brisk
      sallies about the room.

      One poet is vivacious, not at all like the dreamy species to which he
      belongs. True, he wears long hair and a Quartier Latin "plug," but his
      eyes are not vague, and he is immensely fond of Madame Darblay's beans, of
      which he has been known to stow away five platefuls at a meal. Often he
      brings in a copy of <i>Gil Bias</i>, containing a poem by himself in the
      middle of the page and with illustrations by Steinlen.

      A strange, solitary figure used to sit in one corner, speaking to no one,
      and never ordering more than a bowl of chocolate and two sous of bread. It
      was known merely that he was an Hungarian and an artist, and from his
      patched and frayed clothes and meagre fare it was surmised that he was
      poor. But he had a wonderful face. Want was plainly stamped upon it, but
      behind it shone a determination and a hope that nothing could repress.
      There was not a soul among the boarders but that would have been glad to
      assist in easing whatever burden sat upon him, and no doubt it was his
      suspicion of that fact and his dread of its manifestation that made him
      hold absolutely aloof. Madame Darblay once or twice made efforts to get
      nearer to him, but he gently and firmly repulsed her. He was a pitiable
      figure, but his pride was invincible, and with eyes looking straight
      forward, he held up his head and walked like a king. He came and went as a
      shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      None knew where he had a room. There were many stories and conjectures
      about him, but he wrapped his mantle of mystery and solitude about him and
      was wholly inaccessible. It was clear to see that he lived in another
      world,&mdash;a world of hopes, filled with bright images of peace and
      renown. After a time his seat became vacant, and I shall presently tell
      how it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      These will suffice as types of the Maison Darblay, though I might mention
      old M. Decamp, eighty-four years of age, and as hearty and jovial a man as
      one would care to see. In his younger days he had been an actor, having
      had a fame during the Empire of Napoléon III. And there were a professor
      of languages, who gave lessons at fifteen sous an hour, a journalist of
      the <i>Figaro</i>, and two pretty milliner girls from the shop next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great event at the Maison Darblay came not long ago, when M. Darblay's
      two charming daughters had a double wedding, each with a comfortable dot,
      for M. Darblay had grown quite rich out of his restaurant, owning several
      new houses. The girls were married twice,&mdash;once at the Mairie on the
      Rue Gassendi, and again at the Eglise St. Pierre, on the Avenue du Maine.
      Then came the great wedding-dinner at the Maison Darblay, to which all the
      boarders were invited. The tables were all connected, so as to make two
      long rows. The bridal-party were seated at the end next the kitchen, and
      the front door was locked to exclude strangers. M. Darblay was elegant in
      a new dress suit and white shirt, but his tailor, in trying to give him a
      trim figure, made the situation embarrassing, as M. Darblay's girth
      steadily increased during the progress of the banquet. He made a very fine
      speech, which was uproariously cheered.

      Madame Darblay was remarkably handsome in a red satin gown, and bore so
      distinguished an air, and looked so transformed from her usual kitchen
      appearance, that we could only marvel and admire. Then came the kissing of
      the brides, a duty that was performed most heartily. Madame Darblay was
      very happy and proud, and her dinner was a triumph to have lived for.

      Bishop sat opposite the wicked Mademoiselle Brunerye, and he and she made
      violent love, and behaved with conspicuous lack of dignity. M. Fontaine,
      the great, had one of the chic milliners for partner. Old M. Decamp told
      some racy stories of the old régime. When the coffee and liqueurs came on,
      the big artist brought out a guitar and the poet a mandolin, and we had
      music. Then the poet read a poem that he had written for the occasion. The
      actresses sang their sprightliest songs. Mademoiselle Brunerye sang "<i>Ça
      fait toujours plaisir</i>" to Bishop. M. Fontaine gave in a dramatic
      manner a scene from "<i>Les Deux Gosses</i>," the heavy villain assisting,
      the cook's aprons and towels serving to make the costumes. Bishop sang
      "Down on the Farm." In short, it was a splendid evening in Bohemia, of a
      kind that Bohemians enjoy and know how to make the most of.

      There was one silent guest, the strange young Hungarian artist. He ate
      with a ravenous appetite, openly and unashamed. After he had had his fill
      (and Madame Darblay saw to it that he found his plate always replenished),
      he smiled occasionally at the bright sallies of the other guests, but for
      the most part he sat constrained, and would speak only when addressed,&mdash;he
      protested that his French was too imperfect. It was so evident that he
      wished to escape notice entirely that no serious effort was made to draw
      him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a hard winter. A few weeks after the wedding the Hungarian's
      visits to the Maison Dar-blay suddenly ceased. The haunted look had been
      deepening in his eyes, his gaunt cheeks had grown thinner, and he looked
      like a hunted man. After his disappearance the gendarmes came to the
      restaurant to make inquiries about him. Bishop and I were present. They
      wanted to know if the young man had any friends there. We told them that
      we would be his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will take charge of his body?" they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      We followed them to the Rue Perceval, where they turned us over to the
      concierge of an old building. She was very glad we had come, as the lad
      seemed not to have had a friend in the world. She led us up to the sixth
      floor, and then pointed to a ladder leading up to the roof. We ascended
      it, and found a box built on the roof. It gave a splendid view of Paris.
      The door of the box was closed. We opened it, and the young artist lay
      before us dead. There were two articles of furniture in the room. One was
      the bare mattress on the floor, upon which he lay, and the other was an
      old dresser, from which some of the drawers were missing. The young man
      lay drawn up, fully dressed, his coat-collar turned up about his ears.
      Thus he had fallen asleep, and thus hunger and cold had slain him as he
      slept. There was one thing else in the room, all besides, including the
      stove and the bed-covering, having gone for the purchase of painting
      material. It was an unfinished oil-painting of the Crucifixion. Had he
      lived to finish it, I am sure it would have made him famous, if for
      nothing else than the wonderful expression of agony in the Saviour's face,
      an agony infinitely worse than the physical pain of the crucifixion could
      have produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still one thing more,&mdash;a white rat that was, hunting
      industriously for food, nibbling desiccated cheese-rinds that it found on
      the shelves against the wall. It had been the artist's one friend and
      companion in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that, too, is a part of life in Bohemian Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Rue Marie, not far from the Gare Montparnasse, is the "Club," a
      small and artistically dirty wine-shop and restaurant, patronized by a
      select crowd of musketeers of the brush. The warm, dark tones of the
      anciently papered walls are hidden beneath a cloud of oil sketches,
      charcoal drawings, and caricatures of everything and everybody that the
      fancies of the Bohemians could devise. Madame Annaie is mistress of the
      establishment, and her cook, M. Annaie, wears his cap rakishly on one
      side, and attends to his business; and he makes very good potages and
      rôtis, considering the small prices that are charged. Yet even the prices,
      though the main attraction, are paid with difficulty by a majority of the
      habitués, who sometimes fall months in arrears. Madame Annaie keeps a big
      book of accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the members of the club, four are Americans, two Spaniards, one an
      Italian, one a Welshman, one a Pole, one a Turk, one a Swiss, and the rest
      French,&mdash;just fifteen in all, and all sculptors and painters except
      one of the Americans, who is correspondent of a New York paper. At seven
      o'clock every evening the roll is called by the Pole, who acts as
      president, secretary, and treasurer of the club. A fine of two sous is
      imposed for every absence; this goes to the "smoker" fund. Joanskouie, the
      multiple officer, has not many burdensome duties, but even these few are a
      severe tax upon his highly nervous temperament. Besides collecting the
      fines he must gather up also the dues, which are a franc a month. All the
      members are black-listed, including the president himself, and the names
      of the delinquents are posted on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marble-top tables are black with pencil sketches done at the expense
      of Giles, the Welshman, who is the butt of the club. He is a very tall and
      amazingly lean Welshman, with a bewhiskered face, a hooked nose, and a
      frightful accent when he speaks either English or French. He is an animal
      sculptor, but leaves his art carefully alone. He is very clever at drawing
      horses, dogs, and funny cows all over the walls; but he is so droll and
      stupid, so incredibly stupid, that "Giles" is the byword of the club.
      Every month he receives a remittance of two hundred and fifty francs, and
      immediately starts out to get the full worth of it in the kinds of
      enjoyment that he finds on the Boul' Mich', where regularly once a month
      he is a great favorite with the feminine habitués of the <i>café</i>s.
      When his funds run low, he lies perdu till mid-day; then he appears at
      Madame Annaie's, heavy-eyed and stupid, staying until midnight. Sometimes
      he varies this routine by visiting his friends at their studios, where he
      is made to pose in ridiculous attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "smoker" is held on the last Saturday night of each month, and all the
      members are present. Long clay pipes are provided, and a big bowl of
      steaming punch, highly seasoned, comes from Madame Annaie's kitchen.
      Mutually laudatory speeches and toasts, playing musical instruments, and
      singing songs are in order. The Spaniard, with castanets, skilfully
      executes the fandango on a table. Bishop does the danse du ventre.
      Joncierge gives marvellous imitations of Sarah Bernhardt and other
      celebrities, including Giles, whose drawl and stupidity he makes
      irresistibly funny. Nor do Gérôme, Bouguereau, and Benjamin Constant
      escape his mimicry. Haidor, the Turk, drawls a Turkish song all out of
      tune, and is rapturously encored. The Swiss and the Italian render a
      terrific duo from "Aida," and the Spaniards sing the "Bullfighters' Song"
      superbly. Sketches are dashed off continually. They are so clever that it
      is a pity Madame Annaie has to wipe them from the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thanksgiving-day the Americans gave the club a Thanksgiving dinner. It
      was a great mystery and novelty to the other members, but they enjoyed it
      hugely. The turkeys were found without much trouble, but the whole city
      had to be searched for cranberries. At last they were found in a small
      grocery-shop in the American quarter, on the Avenue Wagram. Bishop
      superintended the cooking, M. Annaie serving as first assistant. How M.
      Annaie stared when he beheld the queer American mixtures that Bishop was
      concocting! "Mon Dieu! Not sugar with meat!" he cried, aghast, seeing
      Bishop serve the turkey with cranberry sauce. A dozen delicious
      pumpkin-pies that formed part of the menu staggered the old cook. The
      Italian cooked a pot of macaroni with mushroom sauce, and it was superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Hole in the Wall" eminently deserves its name. It is on the Boulevard
      du Montparnasse, within two blocks of the Bal Bullier. A small iron sign
      projecting over the door depicts two students looking down at the
      passers-by over bowls of coffee, rolls also being shown. It was painted by
      an Austrian student in payment of a month's board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hole is a tiny place, just sufficiently large for its two tables and
      eight stools, fat Madame Morel, the proprietress, and a miniature zinc bar
      filled with absinthe and cognac bottles and drinking glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceiling is so low that you must bend should you be very tall, for
      overhead is the sleeping-room of Madame Morel and her niece; it is reached
      by a small spiral stair.

      A narrow slit in the floor against the wall, where the napkin-box hangs,
      leads down to the dark little kitchen. It is a tight squeeze for Madame
      Morel to serve her customers, but she has infinite patience and geniality,
      and discharges her numerous duties and bears her hardships with unfailing
      good-nature. It is no easy task to cook a halfdozen orders at once, wait
      on the tables, run out to the butcher-shop for a chop or a steak, and take
      in the cash. But she does all this, and much more, having no assistant.
      The old concierge next door, Madame Mariolde, runs in to help her
      occasionally, when she can spare a moment from her own multifarious
      duties. Madame Morel's toil-worn hands are not bien propre, but she has a
      kind heart. For seven years she has lived in this little Hole, and during
      that time has never been farther away than to the grocery-shop on the
      opposite corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her niece leaves at seven o'clock in the morning to sew all day on the
      other side of town, returning at eight at night, tired and listless, but
      always with a half-sad smile. So we see little of her. Many nights I have
      seen her come in drenched and cold, her faded straw hat limp and askew,
      and her dark hair clinging to her wet face. For she has walked in the rain
      all the way from the Avenue de l'Opéra, unable to afford omnibus fare. She
      usually earns from two to two and half francs a day, sewing twelve hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most interesting of the frequenters of the Hole is a Slav from
      Trieste, on the Adriatic. He is a genius in his way, and full of energy
      and business sense. His vocation is that of a "lightning-sketch artist,"
      performing at the theatres. He has travelled all over America and Europe,
      and is thoroughly hardened to the ways of the world. Whenever he runs out
      of money he goes up to the Rue de la Gaieté and gives exhibitions for a
      week or two at one of the theatres there, receiving from fifty to sixty
      francs a week. The students all go to see him, and make such a noise and
      throw so many bouquets (which he returns for the next night) that the
      theatrical managers, thinking he is a great drawing-card, generally raise
      his salary as an inducement to make him prolong his stay when he threatens
      to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he is too thoroughly a Bohemian to remain long in a place. Last week
      he suddenly was taken with a desire to visit Vienna. Soon after he had
      gone four pretty Parisiennes called and wanted to know what had become of
      their amant.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, another of the habitués of the Hole, is a German
      musical student. Strangers would likely think him mentally deranged, so
      odd is his conduct.

    <p>
      He has two other peculiarities,&mdash;extreme sensitiveness and
      indefatigable industry. He brings his shabby violin-case every evening,
      takes out his violin after dinner, and at once becomes wholly absorbed in
      his practice. If he would play something more sprightly and pleasing the
      other habitués of the Hole would not object; but he insists on practising
      the dreariest, heaviest, and most wearing exercises, the most difficult
      études, and the finest compositions of the masters. All this is more than
      the others can bear with patience always; so they wound his sensibilities
      by throwing bread and napkin-rings at him. I hen he retires to the
      kitchen, where, sitting on the cooler end of the range, he practises
      diligently under Madame Morel's benevolent protection. This is all because
      he has never found a concierge willing to permit him to study in his room,
      so tireless is his industry. If I do not mistake, this strange young man
      will be heard from some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a student in sculpture, with
      exceptionally fine talent. He had been an American cowboy, and no trooper
      could swear more eloquently. He has been making headway, for the Salon has
      given him honorable mention for a strong bronze group of fighting tigers.
      His social specialty is poker-playing, and he has brought the entire Hole
      under the spell of that magic game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Prell, from Munich, takes delight in torturing the other habitués
      with accounts of dissections, as he is a medical student at the Académie
      de Médecine. The Swede, who drinks fourteen absinthes a day, throws stools
      at Herr Prell, and tries in other ways to make him fight; but Herr Prell
      only laughs, and gives another turn of the dissection-screw.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glee club is one of the features of the Hole. It sings every night,
      but its supreme effort comes when one of the patrons of the Hole departs
      for home. On such occasions the departing comrade has to stand the dinner
      for all, after which, with its speeches and toasts, he is escorted to the
      railway station with great éclat, and given a hearty farewell, the glee
      club singing the parting song at the station. Bishop is leading tenor of
      the glee club.

      LE CABARET DU SOLEIL D'OR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is only the name
      of the Cabaret of the Golden Sun that suggests the glorious luminary of
      day. And yet it is really brilliant in its own queer way, though that
      brilliancy shines when all else in Paris is dark and dead,&mdash;at night,
      and in the latest hours of the night at that.

    <p>
      My acquaintance with the Golden Sun began one foggy night in a cold
      November, under the guidance of Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lured by the fascinations of nocturnal life in the Quartier Latin, and by
      its opportunities for the study of life in its strangest phases, Bishop
      had become an habitual nighthawk, leaving the studio nearly every evening
      about ten o'clock, after he had read a few hours from treasured books
      gleaned from the stalls along the river, to prowl about with a sketchbook,
      in quest of queer characters and queer places, where strange lives were
      lived in the dark half of the day. His knowledge of obscure retreats and
      their peculiar habitués seemed unlimited. And what an infinite study they
      offer! The tourist, "doing" Bohemian Paris as he would the famous art
      galleries, or Notre-Dame, or the Madeleine, or the <i>café</i>s on the
      boulevards, may, under the guidance of a wise and discerning student,
      visit one after another of these out-of-the-way resorts where the endless
      tragedy of human life is working out its mysteries; he may see that one
      place is dirtier or noisier than another, that the men and women are
      better dressed and livelier here than there, that the crowd is bigger, or
      the lights brighter; but he cannot see, except in their meaningless outer
      aspects, those subtle differences which constitute the heart of the
      matter. In distance it is not far from the Moulin Rouge to the Cabaret du
      Soleil d'Or, but in descending from the dazzling brilliancy and frothy
      abandon of the Red Mill to the smoke and grime of the Golden Sun, we drop
      from the summit of the Tour Eiffel to the rat-holes under the bridges of
      the Seine; and yet it is in such as the Cabaret of the Golden Sun that the
      true student finds the deeper, the more lastingly charming, the strangely
      saddening spell that lends to the wonderful Quartier Latin its distinctive
      character and everlasting fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Bishop spoke to me very little of his midnight adventures, I being
      very busy with my own work, I began to have grave apprehensions on the
      score of his tastes in that direction; for during the afternoons
      ridiculous-looking, long-haired, but gentlemannered persons in shabby
      attire, well-seasoned with the aroma of absinthe and cigarettes, would
      favor our studio with a call, undoubtedly at Bishop's invitation. They
      brought with them black portfolios or rolls of paper tied with black
      string, containing verses,&mdash;their masterpieces, which were to startle
      Paris, or new songs, which, God favoring, were to be sung at La Scala or
      the Ambassadeurs, and thus bring them immortal fame and put abundant fat
      upon their lean ribs! Ah, the deathless hope that makes hunger a welcome
      companion here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop would cleverly entertain these aspiring geniuses with shop talk
      concerning literature and music, and he had a charming way of dwelling
      upon the finish and subtlety of their work and comparing it with that of
      the masters. It usually ended with their posing for him in different
      attitudes of his suggesting. Why waste money on professional models? As
      Bishop's acquaintances became more numerous among this class, we finally
      set aside Tuesday afternoons for their reception. Then they would come in
      generous numbers and enjoy themselves unreservedly with our cognac and
      biscuits. But ah, the rare pleasures of those afternoons,&mdash;as much
      for the good it did us to see their thin blood warmed with brandy and food
      as for their delightful entertainment of us and one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The studio was warm and cheerful on the night when Bishop invited me to
      accompany him out. I had been at work, and presently, when I had finished,
      I flung myself on the divan for a rest and a smoke, and then became aware
      of Bishop's presence. He was comfortably ensconced in the steamer-chair,
      propped up with pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you going out to-night?" I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes. Let's see the time. A little after eleven. That's good. You are
      finished, aren't you? Now, if you want a little recreation and wish to see
      one of the queerest places in Paris, come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked out the window. A cold, dreary night it was. The chimney-pots
      were dimmed by the thick mist, and the street lamps shone murkily far
      below. It was a saddening, soaking, dripping night, still, melancholy, and
      depressing,&mdash;the kind of night that lends a strange zest to in-door
      enjoyment, as though it were a duty to keep the mist and the dreariness
      out of the house and the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the studio had worn me out, and I was eager to escape from its
      pleasant coziness. And this was a Saturday night, which means something,
      even in Paris. To-morrow there would be rest. So I cheerfully assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      We donned our heaviest top-coats and mufflers, crammed the stove full of
      coal, and then sallied out into the dripping fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, but it was cold and dismal in the streets! The mist was no longer the
      obscuring, suggestive, mysterious factor that it had been when seen from
      the window, but was now a tangible and formidable thing, with a manifest
      purpose. It struck through our wraps as though they had been cheesecloth.
      It had swept the streets clear, for not a soul was to be seen except a
      couple of sergents de ville, all hooded in capes, and a cab that came
      rattling through the murk with horses a-steam. Occasionally a flux of warm
      light from some <i>café</i> would melt a tunnel through the monotonous
      opaque haze, but the empty chairs and tables upon the sidewalks facing the
      <i>café</i>s offered no invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0066" id="linkimage-0066"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0181.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      In front of one of these <i>café</i>s, in a sheltered corner made by a
      glass screen, sat a solitary young woman, dressed stylishly in black, the
      light catching one of her dainty slippers perched coquettishly upon a
      foot-rest. A large black hat, tilted wickedly down over her face, cast her
      eyes in deep shadow and lent her that air of alluring mystery which the
      women of her class know so well how to cultivate. Her neck and chin were
      buried deep in the collar of her sealskin cape. A gleam of limp white
      gauze at her throat lent a pleasing relief to the monotone of her attire.
      Upon the table in front of her stood an empty glass and two saucers. As we
      passed she peered at us from beneath her big hat, and smiled coquettishly,
      revealing glistening white teeth. The atmosphere of loneliness and
      desolation that encompassed her gave a singularly pathetic character to
      her vigil. Thus she sat, a picture for an artist, a text for a moralist,
      pretty, dainty, abandoned. It happened not to be her fortune that her
      loneliness should be relieved by us.... But other men might be coming
      afterwards.... All this at a glance through the cold November fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we proceeded up the Boul' Mich' the <i>café</i>s grew more numerous and
      passers-by more frequent, but all these were silent and in a hurry,
      prodded on by the nipping cold fangs of the night. Among the tables
      outside the <i>Café d'Harcourt</i> crouched and prowled an old man,
      bundled in ill-fitting rags, searching for remnants of cigars and
      cigarettes on the sanded sidewalk. From his glittering eyes, full of
      suspicion, he turned an angry glance upon us as we paused a moment to
      observe him, and growled,&mdash;"<i>Allons, tu n' peux donc pas laisser un
      pauv' malheureux?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop tossed him a sou, which he greedily snatched without a word of
      thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0067" id="linkimage-0067"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      At the corner, under the gas-lamps, stood shivering newspaper venders
      trying to sell their few remaining copies of la dernière édition de la
      presse. Buyers were scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had now reached the Place St.-Michel and the left bank of the river. We
      turned to the right, following the river wall toward Notre-Dame, whose
      towers were not discernible through the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was an unbounded wilderness of desolation and solitude. The
      black Seine flowed silently past dark masses that were resolved into big
      canal-boats, with their sickly green lights reflected in the writhing ink
      of the river. Notre-Dame now pushed its massive bulk through the fog, but
      its towers were lost in the sky. Near by a few dim lights shone forth
      through the slatted windows of the Morgue. But its lights never go out.
      And how significantly close to the river it stands! Peering under the
      arches of the bridges, we found some of the social dregs that sleep there
      with the rats. It was not difficult to imagine the pretty girl in black
      whom we had passed coming at last through dissipation and wrinkles and
      broken health to take refuge with the rats under the bridges, and it is a
      short step thence to the black waters of the river; and that the scheme of
      the tragedy might be perfect in all its parts, adjustments, and relations,
      behold the Morgue so near, with its lights that never go out, and boatmen
      so skilled in dragging the river! And the old man who was gathering the
      refuse and waste of smokers, it was not impossible that he should find
      himself taking this route when his joints had grown stiffer, though it
      would more likely end under the bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets are very narrow and crooked around Notre-Dame, and their
      emanations are as various as the capacity of the human nose for evil
      odors. The lamps, stuck into the walls of the houses, only make the
      terrors of such a night more formidable; for while one may feel a certain
      security in absolute darkness, the shadows to which the lamps lend life
      have a baffling elusiveness and weirdness, and a habit of movement that
      makes one instinctively dodge. But that is all the trick of the wind.
      However that may be, it is wonderful how much more vividly one remembers
      on such a night the stories of the murders, suicides, and other crimes
      that lend a particular grewsomeness to the vicinity of the Morgue and
      Notre-Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      We again turned to the right, into a narrow, dirty street,&mdash;the Rue
      du Haut-Pavé,&mdash;whose windings brought us into a similar street,&mdash;the
      Rue Galande. Bishop halted in front of a low arched door-way, which blazed
      sombrely in its coat of blood-red paint. A twisted gas-lamp, demoralized
      and askew, depended overhead, and upon the glass enclosing it was painted,
      with artistic flourishes,&mdash;"Au Soleil d'Or."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the cabaret of the Golden Sun,&mdash;all unconscious of the
      mockery of its name, another of those whimsical disjointings in which the
      shadowy side of Paris is so prolific. From the interior of the luminary
      came faintly the notes of a song, with piano accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archway opened into a small court paved with ill-fitted flint blocks.
      At the farther end of it another gas-lamp flickered at the head of a
      flight of stairs leading underground. As we approached the steps a woman
      sprang from the shadow, and with a cry, half of fear and half of anger,
      fled to the street. At that moment memories of the cosiness of our studio
      became doubly enticing,&mdash;one cannot always approach unfamiliar
      underground Paris with perfect courage. But Bishop's coolness was
      reassuring. He had already descended the steps, and there was nothing left
      for me but to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs were half-glass doors curtained with cheap red
      cloth. A warm, thick, suffocating gust of air, heavy with the fumes of
      beer, wine, and tobacco, assailed our cold faces as we pushed open the
      doors and entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment it was difficult to see clearly, so dense was the smoke. It
      was packed against the ceiling like a bank of fog, diminishing in density
      downward, and shot through with long banner-like streamers of smoke
      freshly emitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human atmosphere of the place could not be caught at once. A stranger
      would not have known for the moment whether he was with thieves or
      artists. But very soon its distinctive spirit made its presence and
      character manifest. The room&mdash;which was not a large one&mdash;was
      well filled with an assortment of those queer and interesting people some
      of whom Bishop had entertained at the studio, only here their
      characteristics were more pronounced, for they were in their natural
      element, depressed and hampered by no constraints except of their own
      devising. A great many were women, although it could be seen at a glance
      that they were not of the nymphs who flitted among the glittering <i>café</i>s,
      gowned in delicate laces and sheeny sculptured silks, the essence of
      mignonette pervading their environment. No; these were different.

    <p>
      Here one finds, not the student life of Paris, but its most unconventional
      Bohemian life. Here, in this underground rendezvous, a dirty old hole
      about twenty feet below the street level, gather nightly the
      happy-go-lucky poets, musicians, and singers for whom the great busy world
      has no use, and who, in their unrelaxing poverty, live in the tobacco
      clouds of their own construction, caring nothing for social canons,
      obeyers of the civil law because of their scorn of meanness, injustice,
      and crime, suffering unceasingly for the poorest comforts of life,
      ambitious without energy, hopeful without effort, cheerful under the
      direst pressure of need, kindly, simple, proud, and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were seated at little round tables, as are the habitués of the <i>café</i>s,
      and their attention was directed upon a slim young fellow with curling
      yellow hair and a faint moustache, who was singing, leaning meanwhile upon
      a piano that stood on a low platform in one corner of the room. Their
      attention was respectful, delicate, sympathetic, and, as might be
      supposed, brought out the best in the lad. It was evident that he had not
      long been a member of the sacred circle. His voice was a smooth, velvety
      tenor, and under proper instruction might have been useful to its
      possessor as a means of earning a livelihood. But it was clear that he had
      already fallen under the spell of the associations to which accident or
      his inclination had brought him; and this meant that henceforth he would
      live in this strange no-world of dreams, hopes, sufferings, and idleness,
      and that likely he would in time come to gather cigar-stumps on the sanded
      pavement of the Café d'Harcourt, and after that sleep with the rats under
      the bridges of the Seine. At this moment, however, he lived in the clouds;
      he breathed and glowed with the spirit of shiftless, proud, starving
      Bohemianism as it is lived in Paris, benignantly disdainful of the great
      moiling, money-grubbing world that roared around him, and perhaps already
      the adoration of some girl of poetic or artistic tastes and aspirations,
      who was serving him as only the Church gives a woman the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was time to look about while he was singing, though that was
      difficult, so strange and pathetic a picture he made. The walls of the
      room were dirty and bare, though relieved at rare intervals by sketches
      and signs. The light came from three gas-burners, and was reflected by a
      long mirror at one end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      No attention had been paid to our entrance, except by the garçon, a
      heavy-set, bull-necked fellow, who, with a sign, bade us make no noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song had finished the audience broke into uproarious applause,
      shouting, "<i>Bravo, mon vieux!" "Bien fait, Marquis!</i>" and the
      clapping of hands and beating of glasses on the marble-topped tables and
      pounding of canes on the floor made a mighty din. The young singer, his
      cheeks glowing and his eyes blazing, modestly rolled up his music and
      sought his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now piloted to seats by the garçon, who, when we had settled
      ourselves, demanded to know what we would drink. "<i>Deux bocks!</i>" he
      yelled across the room. "<i>Deux bocks!</i>" came echoing back from the
      counter, where a fat woman presided&mdash;knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several long-haired littérateurs&mdash;friends of Bishop's&mdash;came up
      and saluted him and shook his hand, all with a certain elegance and
      dignity. He, in turn, introduced me, and the conversation at once turned
      to art, music, and poetry. Whatever the sensational news of the day,
      whatever the crisis in the cabinet, whatever anything might have been that
      was stirring the people in the great outside commonplace world, these men
      and women gave it no heed whatever. What was the gross, hard, eager world
      to them? Did not the glories of the Golden Sun lend sufficient warmth to
      their hearts, and were not their vague aspirations and idle hopes ample
      stimulants to their minds and spirits? They quickly found a responsive
      mood in us, and this so delighted them that they ordered the drinks.

      The presiding genius at the piano was a whitehaired, spiritual-looking
      man, whose snowy locks gave the only indication of his age; for his face
      was filled with the eternal youthfulness of a careless and contented
      heart. His slender, delicate fingers told of his temperament, his thin
      cheeks of his poverty, and his splendid dreamy eyes of the separate life
      that he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing on the platform beside him was a man of a very different type. It
      was' the pianist's function to be merely a musician; but the other man&mdash;the
      musical director&mdash;was one from whom judgment, decision, and authority
      were required. Therefore he was large, powerful, and big- stomached, and
      had a pumpkin head, and fat, baggy eyes that shone through narrow slits.
      He now stepped forward and rang a little bell, upon which all talking was
      instantly hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mesdames et messieurs</i>," he said, in a large, capable voice, "<i>J'ai
      l'honneur de vous annoncer que Madame Louise Leroux, nous lira ses
      dernières oeuvres&mdash;une faveur que nous apprécierons tous</i>."

      A young woman&mdash;about twenty-three, I should judge&mdash;arose from
      one of the tables where she had been sitting talking with an
      insipid-looking gentleman adorned with a blond moustache and vacant,
      staring-eyes; he wore a heavy coat trimmed with astrachan collar and
      cuffs, which, being open at the throat, revealed the absence of a shirt
      from his body. A Latin Quarter top-hat was pushed back on his head, and
      his long, greasy hair hung down over his collar. Madame Leroux smiled
      affectionately at him as she daintily flicked the ashes from her cigarette
      and laid it upon the table, and moistened her thin red lips with a yellow
      liqueur from her glass. He responded with a condescending jerk of his
      head, and, diving into one of the inner pockets of his coat, brought forth
      a roll of paper, which she took. A great clapping of hands and loud cries
      of her name greeted her as she stepped upon the platform, but it was
      clearly to be seen from her indifferent air that she had been long
      accustomed to this attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big musical director again rang his bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Il était une Fois,</i>" she said, simply. The pianist fingered the
      keys softly, and she began to recite.

      The room was as still as a chapel. Every one listened in profound
      absorption; even the stolid bull-necked waiter leaned against the wall,
      his gaze fastened upon her with respectful interest. She spoke slowly, in
      a low, sweet tone, the soft accompaniment of the piano following the
      rhythm of her voice with wonderful effectiveness. She seemed to forget her
      surroundings,&mdash;the hot, close room, crowded with shabby, eccentric
      geniuses who lived from hand to mouth, the poverty that evidently was her
      lot,&mdash;even her lover, who sat watching her with a cold, critical,
      half-disdainful air, making notes upon a slip of paper, now nodding his
      head approvingly, now frowning, when pleased or displeased with her
      performance. She was a rare picture as she thus stood and recited, a
      charming swing to her trim figure, half reclining upon the piano, her
      black hair falling loosely and caressing her forehead and casting her dark
      eyes in deeper shadow, and all her soul going forth in the low, soft,
      subdued passion of her verses. She reminded one greatly of Bernhardt, and
      might have been as great.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her whole rendering of this beautiful and pathetic tale of "other
      times" she scarcely moved, save for some slight gesture that suggested
      worlds. How well the lines suited her own history and condition only she
      could have told. Who was she? What had she been? Surely this strange
      woman, hardly more than a mere girl, capable of such feelings and of
      rendering them with so subtle force and beauty, had lived another life,-
      -no one knew, no one cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud shouts of admiration and long applause rang through the room as she
      slowly and with infinite tenderness uttered the last line with bowed head
      and a choking voice. She stood for a moment while the room thundered, and
      then the noise seemed to recall her, to drag her back from some haunting
      memory to the squalor of her present condition, and then her eyes eagerly
      sought the gentleman of the fur-collared coat. It was an anxious glance
      that she cast upon him. He carelessly nodded once or twice, and she
      instantly became transfigured. The melancholy of her eyes and the wretched
      dejection of her pose disappeared, and her sad face lit up with a beaming,
      happy smile. She was starting to return to him, all the woman in her
      awaking to affection and a yearning for the refuge of his love, when the
      vociferous cries of the crowd for an encore, and the waving of her lover's
      hand as a signal for her to comply, sent her back on guard to the piano
      again. Her smile was very sweet and her voice full of trippling melody
      when she now recited a gay little ballad,&mdash;also her own composition,&mdash;"<i>Amours
      Joyeux</i>,"&mdash;in so entirely different a spirit that it was almost
      impossible to believe her the same mortal. Every fibre of her being
      participated in the rollicking abandon of the piece, and her eyes were
      flooded with the mellow radiance of supreme love satisfied and victorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon regaining her seat she was immediately surrounded by a praise- giving
      crowd, who shook hands with her and heartily congratulated her; but it was
      clear that she could think only of him of the fur collar, and that no word
      of praise or blame would weigh with her the smallest fraction of a
      feather's weight unless this one man uttered it. She disengaged her hand
      from her crowding admirers and deftly donned her little white Alpine hat,
      all the while looking into the face of the one man who could break her
      heart or send her to heaven. He sat looking at his boot, indifferent,
      bored. Presently he looked up into her anxious eyes, gazed at her a
      moment, and then leaned forward and spoke a word. It sent her to heaven.
      Her face all aglow and her eyes shining with happiness, she called the
      garçon, paid for the four saucers upon the table, and left the room upon
      the arm of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she does adore that dog!" exclaimed my friend the musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he do?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do?" he echoed. "Nothing. It is she who does all. Without her he would
      starve. He is a writer of some ability, but too much of a socialist to
      work seriously. In her eyes he is the greatest writer in the world. She
      would sacrifice everything to please him. Without him her life would fall
      into a complete blank, and her recklessness would quickly send her into
      the lowermost ranks. When a woman like that loves, she loves&mdash;ah, <i>les
      femmes sont difficiles à comprendre!</i>" My friend sighed, burying his
      moustaches in a foaming bock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual definition grew clearer as I became more and more accustomed to
      the place and its habitués. It seemed that nearly all of them were
      absinthe-drinkers, and that they drank a great deal,&mdash;all they could
      get, I was made to understand. They care little about their dress and the
      other accessories of their personal appearance, though here and there they
      exhibit the oddest finery, into whose possession they fall by means which
      casual investigation could not discover, and which is singularly out of
      harmony with the other articles of their attire and with the environment
      which they choose. As a rule, the men wear their hair very long and in
      heavy, shaggy masses over their ears and faces. They continually roll and
      smoke cigarettes, though there are many pipes, and big ones at that. But
      though they constitute a strange crowd, there is about them a distinct air
      of refinement, a certain dignity and pride that never fail, and withal a
      gentleness that renders any approach to ruffianism impossible. The women
      take a little more pride in their appearance than the men. Even in their
      carelessness and seeming indifference there abides with nearly all of them
      the power to lend themselves some single touch of grace that is
      wonderfully redeeming, and that is infinitely finer and more elusive than
      the showy daintiness of the women of the <i>café</i>s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, these Bohemians all sleep during the day, as that is the best
      way to keep warm; at night they can find warmth in the cabarets. In the
      afternoon they may write a few lines, which they sell in some way for a
      pittance, wherewithal to buy them a meal and a night's vigil in one of
      these resorts. This is the life of lower Bohemia plain and simple,&mdash;not
      the life of the students, but of the misfit geniuses who drift, who have
      neither place nor part in the world, who live from hand to mouth, and who
      shudder when the Morgue is mentioned,&mdash;and it is so near, and its
      lights never go out! They are merely protestants against the formalism of
      life, rebels against its necessities. They seek no following, they desire
      to exercise no influence. They lead their vacant lives without the
      slightest restraint, bear their poverty without a murmur, and go to their
      dreary end without a sigh. These are the true Bohemians of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other visitors came into the Soleil d'Or and sought seats among their
      friends at the tables, while others kept leaving, bound for other
      rendezvous, many staying just sufficiently long to hear a song or two.
      They were all of the same class, very negligently and poorly attired, some
      displaying their odd pieces of finery with an exquisite assumption of
      unconsciousness on its account, as though they were millionaires and cared
      nothing for such trivial things. And the whimsical incongruities of it! If
      one wore a shining tile he either had no shirt (or perhaps a very badly
      soiled one), or wore a frayed coat and disreputable shoes. In fact, no
      complete respectable dress made its appearance in the room that night,
      though each visitor had his distinctive specialty,&mdash;one a burnished
      top hat, another a gorgeous cravat, another a rich velvet jacket, and so
      on. But they all wore their hair as long as it would grow. That is the
      Bohemian mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little bell again rang, and the heavy director announced that
      "Monsieur Léon Décarmeau will sing one of his newest songs." Monsieur Léon
      Décarmeau was a lean, half-starved appearing man of about forty, whose
      eyes were sunk deep in his head, and whose sharp cheek-bones protruded
      prominently. On the bridge of his thin, angular nose set a pair of
      "pince-nez," attached by a broad black cord, which he kept fingering
      nervously as he sang. His song was entitled "Fleurs et Pensées," and he
      threw himself into it with a broad and passionate eagerness that heavily
      strained the barrier between melodrama and burlesque. His glance sought
      the ceiling in a frenzied quest of imaginary nymphs, his arms swayed as he
      tenderly caressed imaginary flowers of sweet love and drank in their
      intoxicating perfume instead of the hot, tobacco-rife smoke of the room.
      His voice was drawn out in tremendous sighs full of tears, and his chest
      heaved like a blacksmith's bellows. But when he had ceased he was most
      generously applauded and praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the intervals between the songs and recitations the room was noisy
      with laughter, talking, and the clinking of glasses. The one garçon was
      industriously serving boissons and yelling orders to the bar, where the
      fat woman sat industriously knitting, heedless, as might have been
      expected of the keeper of the Cave of Adullam, and awakening to activity
      only when the stentorian yells of the garçon's orders rose above the din
      of the establishment. Absinthe and beer formed the principal beverages,
      though, as a rule, absinthe was taken only just before a meal, and then it
      served as an appetizer,&mdash;a sharpener of hunger to these who had so
      little wherewithal to satisfy the hunger that unaided nature created!
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of the means by which these lighthearted Bohemians sustained
      their precarious existence was not revealed to me; yet here they sat, and
      laughed, and talked, and recited the poetry of their own manufacture, and
      sang their songs, and drank, and smoked their big pipes, and rolled
      cigarettes incessantly, happy enough in the hour of their lives, bringing
      hither none of the pains and pangs and numbing evidences of their
      struggles. And there was no touch of the sordid in the composite picture
      that they made, and a certain tinge of intellectual refinement, a certain
      spirituality that seemed to raise them infinitely above the plane of the
      lowly strugglers who won their honest bread by honest labor, shone about
      them as a halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their dark hours, no doubt, came with the daylight, and in these meetings
      at the cabaret they found an agreeable way in which to while away the
      dismal interval that burdened their lives when they were not asleep; for
      the cabaret was warm and bright, warmer and brighter than their own
      wretched little rooms au cinquième,&mdash;and coal and candles are
      expensive luxuries! Here, if their productions haply could not find a
      larger and more remunerative audience, they could at least be heard,&mdash;by
      a few, it is true, but a most appreciative few, and that is something of
      value equal to bread. And then, who could tell but what fame might
      unexpectedly crown them in the end? It has happened thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why worry?" asked the musician. "'Laugh, and the world laughs with
      you. If we do not live a long life, it is at least a jolly one,' is our
      motto and certainly they gave it most faithful allegiance."
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned from Bishop that the musical director received three francs a
      night for his services. Should singers happen to be lacking, or should the
      evening be dull for other reason, he himself must sing and recite; for the
      tension of the Soleil d'Or must be kept forever taut. The old white-haired
      pianist received two francs a night, and each of these contributors to the
      gayety of the place was given a drink gratis. So there was at least some
      recompense besides the essential one of appreciation from the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glasses clinked merrily, and poets and composers flitted about the room to
      chat with their contemporaries. A sketch artist, deftly drawing the
      portrait of a baritone's jolly little mistress, was surrounded by a
      bantering group, that passed keen, intelligent, and good-natured criticism
      on the work as it rapidly grew under his hands. The whitehaired pianist
      sat puffing at his cigarette and looking over some music with a rather
      pretty young woman who had written popular songs of La Villette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the doors and the straggling entrance of three men sent an
      instant hush throughout the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verlaine!" whispered the musician to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed the great poet of the slums,&mdash;the epitome and idol of
      Bohemian Paris, the famous man whose verses had rung throughout the length
      and breadth of the city, the one man who, knowing the heart and soul of
      the stragglers who found light and warmth in such places as the Soleil
      d'Or, had the brains and grace to set the strange picture adequately
      before the wondering world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musical director, as well as a number of others in the place, stepped
      forward, and with touching deference and tenderness greeted the remarkable
      man and his two companions. It was easy to pick out Verlaine without
      relying upon the special distinction with which he was greeted. He had the
      oddest slanting eyes, a small, stubby nose, and wiry whiskers, and his
      massive forehead heavily overhung his queerly shaped eyes. He was all
      muffled up to the chin; wore a badly soiled hat and a shabby dark coat.
      Under one arm he carried a small black portfolio.

    <p>
      Several of the women ran to him and kissed him on both cheeks, which
      salutations he heartily returned, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his companions was Monsieur Bi-Bi-dans-la-Purée&mdash;so he was
      called, though seemingly he might have been in anything as well as soup.
      He was an exceedingly interesting figure. His sunken, drawn, smooth-
      shaven face gave terrible evidence of the excessive use of absinthe. A
      large hooked nose overshadowed a wide, loose mouth that hung down at the
      corners, and served to set forth in startling relief the sickly leaden
      color of his face. When he spoke, a few straggling teeth gleamed
      unpleasantly. He wore no overcoat, and his jacket hung open, disclosing a
      half-opened shirt that exposed his bare breast. His frayed trousers
      dragged the ground at his heels. But his eyes were the most terrible part
      of him; they shone with the wild, restless light of a madman, and their
      gaze was generally flitting and distrait, acknowledging no acquaintances.
      Afterwards, when Verlaine was dead, I often saw Monsieur
      Bi-Bi-dansla-Purée on the street, looking most desolate, a roll of white
      manuscript in his hand, his coat and shirt wide open, exposing his naked
      breast to the biting cold wind. He seemed to be living altogether in
      another world, and gazed about him with the same unseeing vacant stare
      that so startled me that night in the Soleil d'Or.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Verlaine and his companions were seated&mdash;by displacing the
      artist&mdash;the recitations and songs recommenced; and it was noticeable
      that they were rendered with augmented spirit, that the famous poet of the
      slums might be duly impressed with the capabilities and hospitable
      intentions of his entertainers; for now all performed for Verlaine, not
      for one another. The distinguished visitor had removed his slouch hat,
      revealing the wonderful oblong dome of his bald head, which shone like the
      Soleil d'Or; and many were the kisses reverently and affectionately
      bestowed upon that glistening eminence by the poet's numerous female
      admirers in the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reckless-looking young woman, with a black hat drawn down over her eyes,
      and wearing glasses, was now reciting. Her hands were gloved in black, but
      the finger-tips were worn through,&mdash;a fact which she made all the
      more evident by a peculiar gesture of the fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the small hours grew larger these gay Bohemians waxed gayer and
      livelier. Formalities were gradually abandoned, and the constraint of
      dignity and reserve slowly melted under the mellowing influences of the
      place. Ceremonious observances were dropped one by one; and whereas there
      had been the most respectful and insistent silence throughout the songs,
      now all joined heartily in the choruses, making the dim lights dance in
      the exuberance of the enjoyment. I had earnestly hoped that Verlaine,
      splendid as was his dignity, might thaw under the gathering warmth of the
      hour, but beyond listening respectfully, applauding moderately, and
      returning the greetings that were given him, he held aloof from the
      influence of the occasion, and after draining his glass and bidding
      good-night to his many friends, with his two companions he made off to
      another rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur le Directeur came over to our table and asked Bishop to favor the
      audience with a "<i>chanson Américaine</i>." This rather staggered my
      modest friend, but he finally yielded to entreaties. The director rang his
      little bell again and announced that "Monsieur Beeshup" would sing a song
      <i>à l'Américaine</i>. This was received with uproarious shouts by all,
      and several left their seats and escorted Bishop to the platform. I
      wondered what on earth he would sing. The accompanist, after a little
      coaching from Bishop, assailed the chords, and Bishop began drawling out
      his old favorite, "Down on the Farm." He did it nobly, too, giving the
      accompanist occasion for labor in finding the more difficult harmonies.
      The hearers, though they did not understand a word of the ditty, and
      therefore lost the whole of its pathos, nevertheless listened with curious
      interest and respect, though with evident veiled amusement. Many quick
      ears caught the refrain. At first there came an exceedingly soft chorus
      from the room, and it gradually rose until the whole crowd had thrown
      itself into the spirit of the melody, and swelled it to a mighty volume.
      Bishop led the singers, beating time with his right arm, his left thumb
      meanwhile hooked in the arm-hole of his waistcoat. "<i>Bravo! Bravo,
      Beeshup! Bis!</i>" they yelled, when it was finished, and then the room
      rang with a salvo of hand-clappings in unison: 1-2&mdash;3-4-5&mdash;1-2-3-
      4-5&mdash;1-2-3-4-5&mdash;1&mdash;2&mdash;3!! A great ovation greeted him
      as he marched with glowing cheeks to his seat, and those who knew him
      crowded round him for a hand-shake. The musician asked him if he would
      sing the song in private for him, that he might write down the melody, to
      which Bishop agreed, on condition that the musician pose for him. Bishop
      had a singularly sharp eye for opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch artist sauntered over and sat down at our table to have a chat
      with Bishop. He was a singular fellow. His manner was smoothed by a fine
      and delicate courtesy, bespeaking a careful rearing, whose effects his
      loose life and promiscuous associations could not obliterate. His age was
      about thirty-two, though he looked much older,&mdash;this being due in
      part to his hard life and in other part to the heavy whiskers that he
      wore. An absurd little round felt hat sat precariously on his riotous
      mane, and I was in constant apprehension lest it should fall off every
      time he shook his head. Over his shoulders was a blue cape covering a once
      white shirt that was devoid of a collar. His fingers were all black with
      the crayon that he had used in sketching. He said that he had already
      earned twelve sous that evening, making portraits at six sous a head! But
      there was not so much money to be made in a place like this as in the big
      <i>café</i>s,&mdash;the frequenters were too poor.

      I asked him where he had studied and learned his art, for it could be
      easily seen that he had had some training; his portraits were not half
      bad, and showed a knowledge of drawing. He thereupon told me his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to Paris thirteen years before from Nantes, Brittany, to study
      art. His father kept a small grocery and provision-shop in Nantes, and
      lived in meagre circumstances. The son having discovered what his father
      deemed a remarkable talent for drawing when a boy, the father sent him to
      Paris, with an allowance of a hundred francs a month, and he had to deny
      himself severely to furnish it. When the young man arrived at Paris he
      studied diligently at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for a while, and became
      acquainted with many of the students and models. He soon found the easy
      life of the <i>café</i>s, with the models for companions, more fascinating
      than the dull grind of the school. It was much pleasanter to enjoy the
      gayety of the nights and sleep all day than drone and labor at his easel.
      As his small allowance did not permit of extravagance, he fell deeply into
      debt, and gave more heed to absinthe than his meals,&mdash;it is cheaper,
      more alluring, and brings an exhilaration that sharpens wit and equips the
      soul with wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a whole year the father was in total ignorance of his son's conduct,
      but one day a friend, who had seen the young man in Paris, laid the ugly
      story in his father's ear. This so enraged the father that he instantly
      stopped the remittances and disowned his son. All appeals for money, all
      promises to reform, were in vain, and so the young madcap was forced to
      look about for a means of subsistence. And thus it was that he drifted
      into the occupation of a sketch artist, making portraits in the <i>café</i>s
      all night and sleeping in daytime. This brought him a scant living.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was his mistress, Marcelle, always faithful to him. She worked
      during the day at sewing, and shared her small earnings with him. All went
      fairly well during the summer, but in winter the days were short,
      Marcelle's earnings were reduced, and the weather was bitter cold. Still,
      it was not so bad as it might be, he protested; but underneath his easy
      flippancy I imagined I caught a shadow,&mdash;a flitting sense of the
      hollowness and misery and hopelessness and shame of it all. But I am not
      certain of that. He had but gone the way of many and many another, and
      others now are following in his footsteps, deluding self-denying parents,
      and setting foot in the road which, so broad and shining at the beginning,
      narrows and darkens as it leads nearer and nearer to the rat- holes under
      the bridges of the Seine, and to the grim house whose lights forever shine
      at night under the shadow of Notre-Dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had monsieur a cigarette to spare? Monsieur had, and monsieur thought that
      the thanks for it were out of all proportion to its value; but they were
      totally eclipsed by the praises of monsieur's wonderful generosity in
      paying for a glass of absinthe and sugar for the man who made faces at six
      sous apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet but none the less high tension of the place, the noise of the
      singing, the rattling of glasses and saucers, the stifling foul air of the
      room, filled me with weariness and threatened me with nausea. Things had
      moved in a constant whirl all night, and now it was nearly four o'clock.
      How much longer will this last?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till five o'clock," answered the musician; then all the lights go out,
      and the place is closed; and our friends seek their cold, cheerless rooms,
      to sleep far into the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We paid for our saucers, and after parting adieux left in company with the
      musician and the aesthetic poet. How deliciously sharp and refreshing was
      the cold, biting air as we stepped out into the night! It seemed as though
      I had been breathing molasses. The fog was thicker than ever, and the
      night was colder. The two twisted gas-lamps were no longer burning as we
      crossed the slippery stone-paved court and ascended to the narrow street.
      The musician wrapped a gray muffler about his throat and thrust his hands
      deep into his pockets. The poet had no top-coat, but he buttoned his thin
      jacket tightly about him, and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we have some lait chaud and a croissant?" inquired the musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, anything hot would be good, even milk; but where could we get it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you shall see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not gone far when it gave me a start to recognize a figure that we
      had seen in the Boul' Mich' on our way to the Soleil d'Or. It was that of
      an outcast of the boulevards, now slinking through the shadows toward the
      river. We had been accosted by him in front of one of the brilliant <i>café</i>s,
      as, trembling and rubbing his hands, a picture of hopeless dejection and
      misery, and in a quavering voice he begged us to buy him a drink of
      brandy.
    </p>

      It probably saved him from an attack of delirium tremens that night, but
      here he was drifting, with a singular fatality, toward the river and the
      Morgue. Now, that his day's work of begging was done, all his jackal
      watchfulness had disappeared, and an inner vision seemed to look forth
      from his bleared eyes as their gaze strained straight and dull toward the
      black river. It may have been a mere fancy, but the expression in his eyes
      reminded me strongly of similar things that I had seen on the slabs in the
      Morgue.
    </p>
    <p>
      We crossed the Rue du Haut-Pavé again to the river wall, and arrived at
      the bridge leading back of Notre-Dame and past the Morgue. On the farther
      end of the bridge, propped against the parapet, was a small stand, upon a
      corner of which a dim lamp was burning. In front were a number of
      milk-cans, and on a small counter were a row of thick white bowls and a
      basket of croissants. Inside, upon a small stove, red with heat, were two
      kettles from which issued clouds of steam bearing an odor of boiling milk.
      A stout woman, her face so well wrapped in a shawl that only the end of
      her red nose was visible, greeted us,&mdash;"<i>Bon jour, messieurs. En
      voulez-vous du bon lait bien chaud?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      She poured out four bowls of steaming milk, and gave us each a roll. For
      this luxury we paid three sous each; and a feast it was, for the shivering
      poet, at least, for he licked the hot bowl clean and ate the very crumbs
      of his croissant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were bound for widely separated quarters, our Bohemian friends bade
      us an affectionate good-night, and were soon swallowed up in the gloom. We
      turned towards home and the Boul' Mich'. All the <i>café</i>s were closed
      and dark, but the boulevard was alive with canal-boatmen, street-
      sweepers, and rumbling vegetable- and milk-carts. The streets were being
      washed clean of all evidences of the previous day's life and turmoil, and
      the great city was creeping forth from its lair to begin another.

    <h2>
      THE CAFÉ PROCOPE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the short, busy
      little street, the Rue de l'Ancienne-Comédie, which runs from the
      Boulevard St. Germain, in a line from the Théâtre National de l'Odéon and
      connecting with the Rue Mazarin, its continuation, the heavy dome of the
      Institut looming at its end, is to be found probably the most famous <i>café</i>
      in Paris, for in its day it has been the rendezvous of the most noted
      French littérateurs, politicians, and savants. What is more, the Procope
      was the first <i>café</i> established in Paris, originating the
      appellation "<i>café</i>" to a place where coffee is served, for it was
      here that coffee was introduced to France as an after-dinner comforter.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was when the famous <i>café</i> was in its glory. Some of the great
      celebrities who made it famous have been dead for nearly two hundred
      years, though its greatest fame came a century afterwards; and now the <i>café</i>,
      no longer glorious as it was when the old Théâtre Français stood opposite,
      reposes in a quiet street far from the noise and glitter and life of the
      boulevards, and lives on the splendid memories that crowd it. Other <i>café</i>s
      by the thousand have sprung into existence, and the word has spread to
      coffee saloons and restaurants throughout Christendom; and the ancient
      rive droite nurses the history and relics of the golden days of its glory,
      alone in a quiet street, surrounded by tightly shut shops, and the calm of
      a sleeping village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it retains many of its ancient characteristics and much of the
      old-time quaintness peculiar to itself and setting it wholly apart, and it
      is yet the rendezvous of littérateurs and artists, who, if not so famous
      as the great men in whose seats they sit, play a considerable rôle in the
      life of modern Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of the <i>café</i> is a neat little terrace off the street,
      screened by a fanciful net-work of vines and shrubbery that spring from
      green painted boxes and that conceal cosey little tables and corners
      placed behind them. Instead of the usual showy plate-windows, one still
      finds the quaint old window-panes, very small carreaux, kept highly
      polished by the tireless garçon apprentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tacked to the white pillars are numerous copies of <i>Le Procope</i>, a
      weekly journal published by Théo, the proprietor of the <i>café</i>. Its
      contributors are the authors, journalists, and poets who frequent the <i>café</i>,
      and it publishes a number of portraits besides, and some spirited
      drawings. It is devoted in part to the history of the <i>café</i> and of
      the celebrities who have made it famous, and publishes portraits of them,
      from Voltaire to Paul Verlaine. This same journal was published here over
      two hundred years ago, in 1689, and it was the means then by which the
      patrons of the establishment kept in closer touch with their
      contemporaries and the spirit of the time. Théo is proprietor and business
      manager, as well as editor.

      The modern gas illumination of the <i>café</i>, in contrast to the fashion
      of brilliant lighting that prevails in the showy <i>café</i>s of the
      boulevards, must nevertheless be a great advance on the ancient way that
      it had of being lighted with crude oil lamps and candelabra. But the dim
      illumination is in perfect keeping with the other appointments of the
      place, which are dark, sombre, and funereal. The interior of the Procope
      is as dark as a finely colored old meerschaum pipe. The woodwork, the
      chairs, and the tables are deeply stained by time, the contrasting white
      marble tops of the tables suggesting gravestones; and with all these go
      the deeply discolored walls and the many ancient paintings,&mdash;even the
      caisse, behind which sits Madame Théo, dozing over her knitting. This
      caisse is a wonderful piece of furniture in itself, of some rich dark
      wood, beautifully carved and decorated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Théo is in black, her head resting against the frame of an old
      crayon portrait of Voltaire on the wall behind her. A fat and comfortable
      black cat is asleep in the midst of rows of white saucers and snowy
      napkins. The only garçon, except the garçon apprentice, is sitting in a
      corner drowsing over an evening paper, but ever ready to answer the quiet
      calls of the customers. For in the matter of noise and frivolity the Café
      Procope is wholly unlike the boulevard <i>café</i>s. An atmosphere of
      refined and elegant suppression pervades the place; the roystering spirit
      that haunts the boulevards stops at the portals of the Procope. Here all
      is peace and tranquillity, and that is why it is the haunt of many earnest
      and aspiring poets and authors; for hither they may bring their portfolios
      in peace and security, and here they may work upon their manuscripts,
      knowing that their neighbors are similarly engrossed and that intrusion is
      not to be feared. And then, too, are they not sitting on the same chairs
      and writing at the same tables that have been occupied by some of the
      greatest men in all the brilliant history of France? Is not this the place
      in which greatness had budded and blossomed in the centuries gone? Are not
      these ancient walls the same that echoed the wit, badinage, and laughter
      of the masters? And there are the portraits of the great themselves,
      looking down benignly and encouragingly upon the young strugglers striving
      to follow in their footsteps, and into the ghostly mirrors, damaged by
      time and now sending back only ghosts of shadows, they look as the great
      had looked before them. It is here, therefore, that many of the modern
      geniuses of France have drawn their inspiration, shaking off the endless
      turmoil of the noisy and bustling world, living with the works and
      memories of the ancient dead, and working out their destiny under the
      magic spell that hovers about the place. It is for this reason that the
      habitués are jealous of the intrusion of the curious and worldly. In this
      quiet and secure retreat they feel no impinging of the wearing and
      crippling world that roars and surges through the busy streets and
      boulevards.

      M. Théo de Bellefond is the full name of the proprietor, but he is
      commonly known as M. Théo. He is a jolly little man, with an ambitious
      round stomach, a benevolent face covered with a Vandyke beard, and a
      shining bald head. A large flowing black cravat, tied into an artistic
      négligé bow, hides his shirt. M. Théo came into possession of the Procope
      in 1893, a fact duly recorded on a door panel, along with the names of
      over a score of the celebrities who have made the Procope their place of
      rest, refection, and social enjoyment. M. Procope was a journalist in his
      day, but now the ambition that moves him is to restore the ancient glory
      of the Procope; to make it again the centre of French brains and power in
      letters, art, and politics. To this end he exerts all his journalistic
      tact, a fact clearly shown by the able manner in which he conducts his
      journal, <i>Le Procope</i>. He has worked out the history of the <i>café</i>,
      and has at the ends of his fingers the life- stories of its famous
      patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Café Procope was founded in 1689 by François Procope, where it now
      stands. Opposite was the Comédie Française, which also was opened that
      year. The <i>café</i> soon became the rendezvous of all who aspired to
      greatness in art, letters, philosophy, and politics. It was here that
      Voltaire, in his eighty-second year, while attending the rehearsals of his
      play, "Irène," descended from his chaise-à-porteur at the door of the Café
      Procope, and drank the coffee which the <i>café</i> had made fashionable.
      It was here also that he became reconciled to Piron, after an estrangement
      of more than twenty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ste.-Foix made trouble here one day about a cup of chocolate. A duel with
      the proprietor of the <i>café</i> was the immediate result, and after it
      Ste.-Foix, badly wounded, exclaimed, "Nevertheless, monsieur, your
      sword-thrust does not prevent my saying that a very sickly déjeuner is une
      tasse de chocolat!"

      Jean-Jacques Rousseau, after the successful representation of "Le Devin de
      Village," was carried in triumph to the Procope by Condorcet, who, with
      Jean-Jacques on his shoulders, made a tour of the crowded <i>café</i>,
      yelling, "Vive la Musique Française!" Diderot was fond of sitting in a
      corner and manufacturing paradoxes and materialistic dissertations to
      provoke the lieutenant of police, who would note everything he said and
      report it to the chief of police. The lieutenant, ambitious though stupid,
      one night told his chief that Diderot had said one never saw souls; to
      which the chief returned, "M. Diderot se trompe. L'âme est un esprit, et
      M. Diderot est plein d'esprit."

      Danton delighted in playing chess in a quiet corner with a strong
      adversary in the person of Marat. Many other famous revolutionists
      assembled here, among them Fabre d'Eglantine, Robespierre, d'Holbach,
      Mirabeau, Camille Desmoulins. It was here that Camille Desmoulins was to
      be strangled by the reactionists in the Revolution; it was here that the
      first bonnet rouge was donned. The massacre of December, 1792, was here-
      planned, and the killing began at the very doors of the <i>café</i>.
      Madame Roland, Lucille Desmoulins, and the wife of Danton met here on the
      ioth of August, the day of the fall of the monarchy, when bells rang and
      cannon thundered. It was later that Bonaparte, then quite young and living
      in the Quai Conti, in the building which the American Art Association now
      occupies, left his hat at the Procope as security for payment for a drink,
      he having left his purse at home. In short, the old <i>café</i> of the Rue
      des Fossés-St.-Ger-main (its old name) was famous as the meeting-place of
      celebrities. Legendre, the great geometrician, came hither. One remembers
      the verses of Masset: "Je joue aux dominos quelquefois chez Procope." Here
      Gambetta made speeches to the reactionist politicians and journalists. He
      engaged in more than one prise de bec with le père Coquille, friend of
      Veuillot. Coquille always made sprightly and spirited replies when
      Gambetta roared, thundered, and swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then have followed days of calm. In later times Paul Verlaine was a
      frequenter of the Procope, where he would sit in his favorite place in the
      little rear salon at Voltaire's table. This little salon, in the rear of
      the <i>café</i>, is held sacred, for its chair and table are the ones that
      Voltaire used to occupy. The table is on one side of the small room. On
      the walls are many interesting sketches in oil by well-known French
      artists, and there are fine ceiling decorations; but all these are seen
      with difficulty, so dim is the light in the room. Since Voltaire's time
      this table has become an object of curiosity and veneration. When
      celebrated habitués of the <i>café</i> died this table was used as an
      altar, upon which for a time reposed the bust of the decedent before
      crêpe-covered lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Revolution Hébert jumped upon this table, which had been placed
      before the door of the <i>café</i>, and harangued the crowd gathered
      there, exciting them to such a pitch that they snatched the newspapers
      from the hands of the news-venders. In a moment of passionate appeal he
      brought down his heavy boot-heel upon the marble with such force as to
      split it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>café</i> are three doors that are decorated in a very
      interesting fashion. On the panels of one, well preserved in spite of the
      numerous transformations through which the establishment has gone, M. Théo
      conceived the happy idea of inscribing in gold letters the names of the
      illustrious who have visited the <i>café</i> since its founding. Many of
      the panels of the Avails are taken with full-length portraits by Thomas,
      representing, among others, Voltaire, Rousseau, Robespierre, Diderot,
      Danton and Marat playing chess, Mirabeau, and Gambetta. There are smaller
      sketches by Corot, d'Aubigny, Vallon, Courbet, Willette, and Roedel. Some
      of them are not fine specimens of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Théo is a devoted collector of rare books and engravings. His library,
      which contains many very rare engravings of the eighteenth century and
      more than one book of priceless value, is open to his intimate friends
      only, with whom he loves to ramble through his treasures and find
      interesting data of his <i>café</i>.

      LE MOULIN DE LA GALETTE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ISHOP had been
      industriously at work upon a large black-and-white drawing. The subject
      was a ball-room scene,&mdash;of evident low degree, judging from the
      abandon of the whirling figures and the queer types that were depicted.
      White lace skirts were sweeping high in air, revealing black-stockinged
      ankles and gauzy lingerie in a way unknown to the monde propre.

      In contrast to the grace and abandon of the female figures were the
      coarseness and clumsiness of their male partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was nearly finished, but Bishop professed to be dissatisfied with
      the foreground architecture and with the drawing of a hand belonging to
      one of the male dancers. After boring me at length with a speech on the
      necessity of having a model for that hand, he sheepishly asked me if I
      would pose for the elusive member. It was then that curiosity prompted me
      to inquire where he had found the original of this remarkable scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mon enfant sculpteur</i>," he replied, with the patronizing air of a
      man of the world, "this is the Moulin de la Galette."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where is that?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you to-morrow night, if you agree."
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow would be Sunday. When it had passed and the evening was come,
      and after we had enjoyed two courses of Madame Darblay's juicy gigots and
      irresistible beans, with the incomparable sauce afforded by the presence
      of the sunny actresses who were there, we walked over to the Boulevard
      St.-Jacques and waited for the Montmartre 'bus to come along. These small,
      ancient omnibuses are different from the other vehicles of that breed in
      Paris, in that instead of having a narrow curved stairway at the rear
      leading up to the impériale, there are but three or four iron foot-rests
      against the outside of the rear wall, with an iron rod on either side to
      cling to in mounting. Now, the traveller who would reach the impériale
      must be something of either an acrobat or a sailor, because, first, as
      these 'buses do not stop, a running leap has to be made for the ladder,
      and, second, because of the pitching and rolling of the lumbering vehicle,
      the catching and climbing are not easy. If you carry a cane or a parcel,
      it must be held in the teeth until the ascent is made, for both hands have
      all they can do in the ladder exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gleam of the red lamp coming down the street prepared us for a test of
      our agility. As only one could mount the ladder at a time, and as I was
      the first to attack the feat, Bishop had to run behind for nearly a block
      before I could give him the right of way up the ladder. The conductor
      registered deux sur l'impériale as we swung to the top and took seats
      forward, just behind the driver. Ladies and fat gentlemen are rarely, or
      never, found riding on the impériale of the Montmartre line.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wrapped up in our big warm coats and lay back smoking three-sous cigars
      (always three-sous ones on Sunday), and as the driver cracked his whip and
      the heavy machine went rolling along, we enjoyed the wonderful treat of
      seeing gay Paris of a Sunday night from the top of an omnibus. There is
      hardly anything more delightful, particularly from the top of a St.
      Jacques-Montmartre 'bus, which generally avoids the broad, brilliant
      streets and goes rolling and swaying through the narrow, crooked streets
      of old Paris. Here there is hardly room for such a vehicle to pass, and
      one is anxious lest one's feet sweep off the gas-lamps that fly past. An
      intimate view of the domestic life of Paris presents itself likewise, for,
      being on a level with the second story windows, you have flitting visions
      of the Parisian ménage in all its freedom and variety. At this time of the
      evening the windows are wide open and the dinner-tables are spread near
      them, for a view of the street below.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on we rumbled, through seemingly interminable miles of crooked
      streets, over the gay Boul' Mich', and the Place St.-Michel; across the
      river, which reflected the myriads of lights along its walls and bridges;
      past the Halles, the greatest marketplace in the world; past the grand
      boulevards, a confusing glitter of colors and lights; past the
      Folies-Bergère, where flaming posters announced Loie Fuller in the throes
      of a fire dance; and at last to the steep grade of Montmartre. Here a
      third horse was added to the pair, and slowly we were dragged up the
      slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Boulevard Clichy we suddenly found ourselves in the midst of a
      terrific uproar; bells, steam-whistles, hand-organs, bands of music,
      drums, and calliopes made the bedlam. The streets were blocked with moving
      masses of laughing people, and the scene was gayly illuminated by rows of
      lamps overhead and on hundreds of stands, merry-go-rounds, theatres,
      circuses, museums, and all kinds of catchpenny attractions that lined the
      boulevard. For this was the Fête de Clichy. Far down the street, almost
      hidden by a curve, could be seen the illuminated arms of the Moulin Rouge
      slowly revolving through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still on and up crawled the 'bus, now in the very heart of Montmartre,
      through the lively, crowded, bright streets on the great hill of Paris.
      Here are hot-chestnut venders at the corners; fried-potato women, serving
      crisp brown chips; street hawkers, with their heavy push-carts;
      song-sellers, singing the songs that they sell, to make purchasers
      familiar with the airs; flower-girls; gaudy shops; bright restaurants and
      noisy <i>café</i>s,&mdash;all constituting that distinctive quarter of
      Paris, Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the summit of the hill was made, and the panting horses must have
      been glad that it was all down-hill ahead. Bishop gave the signal to
      alight a block before the desired street was reached, for by the time we
      could touch the ground the 'bus had covered that distance on the down run.
      Bishop led the way up a dim little street,&mdash;the Rue Muller, I noticed
      on the wall. It was very steep, and at last ended at the bottom of a
      flight of stone steps that seemed to run into the sky. Their length was
      marked by lamps glowing one above another in long rows. It was hard work
      climbing to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top at last! We seemed to be among the clouds. Far below us lay the
      great shining city, spreading away into distance; and although it was
      night, the light of a full moon and untold thousands of lamps in the
      streets and buildings below enabled us easily to pick out the great
      thoroughfares and the more familiar structures. There was the Opéra, there
      the Panthéon, there Notre-Dame, there St.-Sulpice, there the Invalides,
      and, uplifted to emulate the eminence on which we stood, the Tour Eiffel,
      its revolving searchlight at the apex shining like an immense meteor or
      comet with its misty trail stretching out over the city. The roar of life
      faintly reached our ears from the vast throbbing plain, where millions of
      human mysteries were acting out their tragedies. The scene was vast,
      wonderful, entrancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far above us still a maze of rafters, beams, and scaffolding fretted the
      sky,&mdash;the skeleton of that beautiful but unfinished Church of the
      Sacré- Cour, crowning the very summit of Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be no life here, for not a soul did we meet, and not a
      light shone except that of the moon. Bishop guided me through a maze of
      steep stony passages, between the walls of dark gardens, turning now to
      the right, again to the left, through archways and courts; and I wondered
      how he could remember them all. Before I could fully comprehend our
      position we were confronted by two black, gaunt, uncanny objects with long
      outstretched arms that cut across the sky like giant skeleton sentinels
      forbidding our farther advance. But the sounds of lively music and the
      glow of rows of white-globed lamps quickly banished the illusion and
      advertised the fact that we were in a very material and sensual world, for
      they announced the Moulin de la Galette at the foot of the passage. The
      spectres against the sky were only very, very old windmills, relics of the
      time, three centuries gone, when windmills crowded the summit of
      Montmartre to catch all the winds that blew. Now they stand, stark, dead,
      silent, and decaying; their stately revolutions are no more; and the
      skeleton frames of their fans look down on a marvellous contrast, the
      intensely real life of the Galette.

      We fell in line with many others at the ticket office, and paid the fifty
      centimes admission fee (ladies twenty-five centimes). We were relieved of
      our hats and canes by a stout old woman in the vestiaire, who claimed two
      sous from each. Following the up-hill passage of the entrance, the walls
      of which are painted with flowers and garden scenes, we entered the great
      ball-room. What a brilliant scene of life and light!&mdash;at first a blur
      of sound, light, and movement, then gradually resolving into the simple
      elements composing it. The floor was covered with dancers, and the girls
      were making a generous display of graceful anatomy. A large band at the
      farther end of the room, on an inclined stand, was the vortex of the din.
      The promenade encircling the hall was crowded with hatless laughing girls
      and smooth-faced boys wearing caps or flat-brimmed low-crowned hats; their
      trousers fitted tight at the knees, and their heads were closely cropped.
      These were strolling in groups, or watching the dancers, or sitting at the
      rows of wooden tables drinking. All within the vast hall had gone to enjoy
      their Sunday night as much as possible. To most of the girls this was the
      one night in the week when, not tired out from the drudgery of hard work,
      they could throw aside all cares and live in the way for which their
      cramped and meagre souls yearned. This is a rendezvous for the humble
      workers of the city, where they may dress as best they can, exchange their
      petites histoires, and abandon themselves to the luxury of the dance; for
      they are mostly shop-girls, and blanchisseuses, and the like, who, when
      work fails them, have to hover about the dark streets at night, that
      prosperous-looking passers-by may be tempted by the pleading of their dark
      saucy eyes, or be lured by them to some quiet spot where their lovers lie
      in wait with a lithe and competent black slung-shot. No mercy for the
      hapless bourgeois then! For the dear Henris and Jacques and Louises must
      have their sous for the comforts of life, as well as the necessities, and
      such luxuries as tobacco and drink must be considered; and if the money
      wherewith all this may be bought is not produced by Marcelle or Hélène or
      Marie, she will get a beating for her slothfulness or lack of skill, and
      will be driven into the street with a hurting back to try again. And so
      Henri, Jacques, or Louis basks in the sun, and smokes cigarettes with
      never a care, except that of making his devoted little mistress perform
      her duties, knowing well how to retain her affection by selfishness and
      brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      This night, however, all that was forgotten. It was the one free, happy
      night of the week, the night of abandon and the dance, of laughter,
      drinking, and jollity, for which one and all had longed for a whole
      impatient and dreary week; and Henri, Jacques, and Louis could spend on
      drinks with other of their feminine acquaintances the sous that their
      mistresses had provided. The band played lustily; the lights shone; the
      room was filled with laughter,&mdash;let the dance go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      Stationed in different parts of the room were the big soldiers of the
      Garde Municipale, in their picturesque uniform so familiar to all the
      theatre-goers of Paris. They were here to preserve order, for the dancers
      belong to an inflammable class, and a blaze may spring up at any moment.
      Equally valuable as a repressing force was a burly, thick- necked,
      powerful man who strolled hither and thither, his glance everywhere and
      always veiling a threat. He wore a large badge that proclaimed him the
      master of ceremonies. True, he was that, which was something, but he was a
      great deal more,&mdash;a most astonishingly prompt and capable bouncer.
      The male frequenters of the place were evidently in mortal terror of him,
      for his commanding size and threatening manner, and his superbly developed
      muscles, contrasted strikingly with the cringing manner and weak bodies of
      Henri and his kind; and should he look their way with a momentary
      steadiness of glance and poise of figure, their conversation would
      instantly cease, and they would slink away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We seated ourselves at a vacant table that commanded a sweeping view of
      the floor and the promenade. A seedy-looking garçon worked his way through
      the crowd and took our order for beer; and mean, stale beer it was. But we
      did not care for that. Bishop was all afire with enjoyment of the scene,
      for, he protested, the place was infinitely rich in types and character,&mdash;the
      identical types that the great Steinlen loves to draw. And here is an
      interesting thing: The girls all were of that chic and petite order so
      peculiar to certain classes of Parisian women, some hardly so high as
      Bishop's shoulder, which is itself not very high; and though they looked
      so small, they were fully developed young women, though many of them were
      under twenty. They wore no hats, and for the most part, unlike their
      gorgeous sisters of the boulevard <i>café</i>s, they were dressed plainly,
      wearing black or colored waists and skirts. But ah!&mdash;and here the
      unapproachable instinct-skill of the French-woman shows itself,&mdash;on
      these same waists and skirts were placed here and there, but always just
      where they ought to be, bows and ribbons; and it was they that worked the
      miracle of grace and style. And the girls had a certain beauty, a beauty
      peculiar to their class,&mdash;not exactly beauty, but pleasing features,
      healthy color, and, best of all and explaining all, an archness of
      expression, a touch of sauciness, that did for their faces what the bows
      and ribbons did for their gowns.

      Near us a large door opened into the garden of the Moulin; it was filled
      with trees and benches and tables, and amidst the dark foliage glowed
      colored Chinese lanterns, which sifted a soft light upon the revellers
      assembled beneath them in the cool evening air. On one side of the garden
      stretched Paris far down and away, and on the other side blazed the Moulin
      de la Galette through the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A waltz was now being danced. Strange to say, it was the one dismal
      feature of the evening, and that was because the French do not know how to
      dance it, "reversing" being unknown. And there was an odd variety of ways
      in which the men held their partners and the dancers each other. Some
      grasped each other tightly about the waist with both arms, or similarly
      about the necks or shoulders, and looked straight into each other's face
      without a smile or an occasional word. It was all done in deadly earnest,
      as a serious work. It was in the quadrille that the fun came, when the
      girls varied the usual order by pointing their toes toward the chandeliers
      with a swish of white skirts that made the by- standers cry, "Encore,
      Marcelle!" The men, yearning for a share of the applause, cut up all sorts
      of antics and capers, using their arms and legs with incredible agility,
      making grotesque faces, and wearing hideous false noses and piratical
      moustaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Securing a partner for a dance was the easiest thing possible. Any girl
      was eligible,&mdash;simply the asking, the assent, and away they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop's pencil kept moving rapidly as he caught fleeting notes of faces,
      dresses, attitudes&mdash;everything&mdash;for his unfinished piece at the
      studio. A number of promenaders, attracted by his sketching, stopped to
      watch him. That dance was now finished, and the dancers separated wherever
      they stopped, and turned away to seek their separate friends; there was no
      waste of time in escorting the girls to seats, for that is not fashionable
      at Montmartre. The girls came flocking about Bishop, curious over his
      work, and completely shut out his view. "Oh!" exclaimed one saucy petite
      blonde, "let me see my portrait! I saw you sketching me during the dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Et moi,&mdash;moi aussi!</i>" cried the others, until Bishop,
      overwhelmed, surrendered his book for the inspection of bright, eager
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has not monsieur a cigarette?" archly asked a girl with a decided nez
      retroussé. "<i>Oui</i>," I answered, handing her a packet, from which with
      exquisite, unconscious daintiness she selected one. The whole bevy then
      made a similar request, and we were soon enveloped in a blue haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Vous ferez mon portrait, n'est-ce-pas?</i>" begged a dark-eyed beauty
      of Bishop, in a smooth, pleasant voice. She had a striking appearance. A
      mass of rebellious black hair strove persistently to fall over her oval
      face, and when she would neglect to push it back her eyes, dark and
      melancholy, shone through its tangle with a singular wild lustre. Her skin
      was dark, almost swarthy, but it was touched with a fine rosy glow of
      health and youth. Her features were perfect; the nose was slightly
      romanesque, the chin firm, the lips red and sensuous. When she drew our
      attention with her request she was standing before us in a rigid, half-
      defiant, half-commanding posture; but when she quickly added, "I will pose
      for you,&mdash;see?" and sat down beside me, opposite Bishop, her striking
      native grace asserted itself, for from a statue of bronze she suddenly
      became all warmth and softness, every line in her perfect, lithe figure
      showing her eagerness, and eloquent with coaxing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that Bishop was deeply impressed by the striking picture that
      she made; it was her beautiful wild head that fascinated him most.

    <p>
      "No, I am first," insisted a little vixen, hard-featured and determined. "<i>Jamais
      de la vie!" "C'est moi!</i>" protested others, with such fire that I
      feared there would be trouble. The turmoil had the effect of withdrawing
      Bishop's attention momentarily from the beautiful tigress beside me. He
      smiled in bewilderment. He would be happy to draw them all, but&mdash;&mdash;
      At last he pacified them by proposing to take them in turn, provided they
      would be patient and not bother him. To this they poutingly agreed; and
      Bishop, paying no more attention to the girl beside me, rapidly dashed off
      sketch after sketch of the other girls. Exclamations of surprise, delight,
      or indignation greeted each of the portraits as it was passed round.
      Bishop was seeking "character," and as he was to retain the portraits, he
      made no efforts at flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the dark-eyed one had sat in perfect silence and stillness
      beside me, watching Bishop in wonder. She had forgotten her hair, and was
      gazing through it with more than her eyes as his pencil worked rapidly. I
      studied her as well as I could as she sat all heedless of my existence.
      Her lips slightly curved at the corners into a faint suggestion of a
      smile, but as Bishop's work kept on and the other girls monopolized him,
      the lips gradually hardened. The shadow of her chin fell upon her smooth
      throat, not darkening it too much for me to observe that significant
      movements within it indicated a struggle with her self- control. Bishop
      was now sketching a girl, the others having run off to dance; they would
      return in their order. The girl beside me said to me, in a low voice,
      without looking at me,&mdash;"<i>Monsieur est Anglais?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Américain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your friend?" nodding toward Bishop. "American also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he&mdash;&mdash;" but she suddenly checked herself with odd
      abruptness, and then quickly asked, with a shallow pretence of eager
      interest, "Is America far from Paris?" And so she continued to quiz me
      rather vacantly concerning a great country of whose whereabouts she had
      not the slightest idea. Then she was silent, and I imagined that she was
      gathering herself for some supreme effort. Suddenly she turned her
      marvellous eyes full toward me, swept the wild hair from her face, looked
      almost fiercely at me a moment, and, rigid from head to foot, asked, half
      angrily, and then held her breath for the answer,&mdash;"Is he married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was asked so suddenly and so strangely, and with so
      commanding a manner, that I had not a moment to consider the wisdom of
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back into her chair with a deep breath, all softness and grace
      again, and her wild hair fell back over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had lost all interest in the ball. While her companions were enjoying
      themselves in the dance, she sat motionless and silent beside me, watching
      Bishop. An uncomfortable feeling had taken possession of me. Presently I
      abruptly asked her why she did not dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. "Dance?" she replied. She looked over the hall, and an
      expression of scorn and disgust came into her face. "Not with that espèce
      de voyous," she vehemently added; and then she turned to watch Bishop
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now noticed for the first time that a group of the human vampires,
      standing apart at a little distance, were watching us closely and talking
      in low tones among themselves. My attention had been drawn to them by a
      defiant look that the girl had shot at them. One of them was particularly
      repulsive. He was rather larger and stronger than the others. His garb was
      that of his species,&mdash;tight trousers, a négligé shirt, and a rakish
      cap being its distinguishing articles. He stood with his hands in his
      pockets and his head thrust forward. He had the low, brutal face of his
      kind. It was now pale with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the girl what her name was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hélène," she answered, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her other name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, just Hélène. Sometimes it was Hélène Crespin, for Crespin was her
      lover's name. All this with perfect frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>C'est lui avec la casquette</i>," she answered, indicating the brute
      whom I have just described, but I had expected that. "I hate him now!" she
      vehemently added.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she had neither father nor mother; had no recollection of parents.
      Sometimes she worked in a printing shop in the Rue Victor Massé when extra
      hands were needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the girl who had been posing was dismissed another took her place;
      then another, and another, and others; and still others were waiting. The
      girl beside me had been watching these proceedings with increasing
      impatience. Some of the girls were so delighted that they threw their arms
      round Bishop's neck and kissed him. Others called him endearing names. At
      last it was evident that the dark girl could bear it no longer. She had
      been growing harder and harder, more and more restless. I continued to
      watch her narrowly,&mdash;she had forgotten my existence. Gradually the
      natural rich color in her cheeks deepened, her eyes blazed through the
      tangled hair, her lips were set. Suddenly, after a girl had been more
      demonstrative than the others, she rose and confronted Bishop. All this
      time he had not even looked at her, and that, while making me uneasy, had
      made her furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      We three were alone. True, we were observed by many, for invasions by
      foreigners were very rare at the Moulin de la Galette, and we were objects
      of interest on that account; and the sketching by Bishop had sent our fame
      throughout the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a low, quiet voice the girl said to Bishop, as he looked up at her
      wonderingly,&mdash;"You promised to draw mine long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen my friend more embarrassed than he was at that moment. He
      stumbled over his excuses, and then asked her to pose to suit her fancy.
      He did it very gently, and the effect was magical. She sank into her chair
      and assumed the indolently graceful pose that she had unconsciously taken
      when she first seated herself. Bishop gazed at her in silence a long time
      before he began the sketch; and then he worked with a sure and rapid hand.
      After it was finished he handed it to her. Instantly she was transfigured.
      She stared at the picture in wonder and delight, her lips parted, her
      chest hardly moving from her nearly suppressed breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look like that?" she asked, suspiciously. Indeed, it was an
      exquisite little piece of work, for Bishop had idealized the girl and made
      a beautiful portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not see me draw it while looking at you?" he replied, somewhat
      disingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give it to me?" she asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you sign your name to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop cheerfully complied. Then she took it, kissed it, and pressed it to
      her bosom; and then, leaning forward, and speaking with a richness and
      depth of voice that she had not betrayed before, and in the deepest
      earnestness, said,&mdash;"<i>Je vous aime!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop, staggered by this forthright declaration of affection, blushed
      violently and looked very foolish. But he rallied and assured her that her
      love was reciprocated, for who, he asked, could resist so beautiful a
      face, so warm a heart? If he had only known, if I could only have told
      him! The girl sank back in her chair with a quizzical, doubting smile that
      showed perfect white teeth and changed to bright dimples the suggestion of
      a smile that fluttered at her mouth-corners. She carefully folded the
      sketch and daintily tucked it away in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop had now quitted work,&mdash;Hélène had seen to that. She had moved
      her chair close to his, and, looking him straight in the eyes, was
      rattling away in the untranslatable argot of Montmartre. It is not the
      argot of the slums, nor that of the thieves, nor that of the students, but
      that of Montmartre; and there are no ways of expressing it intelligibly in
      English. Presently she became more serious, and with all the coaxing and
      pleading of which her ardent, impetuous nature was capable, she begged,&mdash;
      "Let me be your model. <i>Je suis bien faite</i>, and you can teach me to
      pose. You will be kind to me. I have a good figure. I will do everything,
      everything for you! I will take care of the studio. I will cook, I will
      bring you everything, everything you want. You will let me live with you.
      I will love no one else. You will never be sorry nor ashamed. If you will
      only&mdash;&mdash;" That is the best translation I can give; it is
      certainly what she meant, though it indicates nothing of the impetuosity,
      the abandon, the eagerness, the warmth, the savage beauty that shone from
      her as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop rose to the occasion. He sprang to his feet. "I must dance after
      that!" he exclaimed, catching her up, laughing, and dragging her upon the
      floor. He could dance superbly. A waltz was being played, and it was being
      danced in the stiff and stupid way of the people. Very soon Bishop and
      Hélène began to attract general attention, for never before had Montmartre
      seen a waltz danced like that. He reversed, and glided, and threw into the
      queen of dances all the grace and freedom that it demands. At first Hélène
      was puzzled and bewildered; but she was agile both of mind and body, and
      under Bishop's sure guidance she put them to excellent use. Rapidly she
      caught the grace and spirit of the waltz, and danced with a verve that she
      had never known before. Swiftly and gracefully they skimmed the length of
      the great hall, then back, and wherever they went the dancers watched them
      with astonishment and delight, and gradually abandoned their own
      ungraceful efforts, partly in shame, partly in admiration, and partly with
      a desire to learn how the miracle was done. Gradually the floor was wholly
      abandoned except for these two, and all eyes watched them. Hélène was
      happy and radiant beyond all ways of telling. Her cheeks were flushed, her
      eyes sparkled, her lithe figure developed all the ease, grace, and
      suppleness of a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some muttered expressions of contempt spoken near me caused me to listen
      without turning round. They were meant for my ears, but I gave no heed. I
      knew well enough from whom they came,&mdash;Crespin and his friends. And I
      realized that we were in for it. True, there were the big guards and there
      was the capable bouncer, and they would glance my way now and then,
      seemingly to let Crespin know that all was understood and that it must be
      hands off with him. There was no danger here, but afterwards&mdash;The
      waltz came to an end, and the two were vigorously applauded. This was a
      critical moment, but Bishop handled it adroitly. He conducted Hélène to a
      seat remote from our table, bowed low, and left her, and came over to me.
      I told him of my fears, but he laughed. He had got rid of Hélène with
      perfect address, and perhaps she was nursing an angry and aching heart
      after her glorious triumph; perhaps Bishop had whispered to her something
      of the danger and suggested that they have nothing more to do with each
      other that evening.

    </div>
    <p>
      Presently I saw her start and look round. Crespin was behind her, livid
      with rage. She promptly rose and followed him into the garden. Bishop had
      not seen the movement. We were near the door leading into the garden, and
      by turning a little I could see the couple outside, not far away. Crespin
      was standing with a bullying air, and was evidently cursing her. She had
      tossed back her hair and was looking him defiantly in the face. I saw her
      lips move in speech. Instantly the ruffian dealt her a violent blow upon
      the chest, and she staggered back against a tree, which prevented her
      falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let us stop that," I said to Bishop. "Hélène's lover is beating her
      in the garden." Bishop sprang to his feet and followed me. As he glanced
      out the window at the couple, whom I pointed out, he saw Crespin approach
      the dazed girl and deal her a terrible blow in the mouth, and he saw the
      blood that followed the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived in the garden as a crowd was gathering. Bishop pushed his way
      ahead and was about to spring upon the brute, when Hélène saw him. With a
      supreme effort she leaped forward, thrust Bishop aside with a command to
      mind his own affairs, threw herself into her lover's arms, and kissed him,
      smearing his face with her blood. He glared at us, triumphant. The guards
      arrived, and Hélène and her lover disappeared among the trees in the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, another unfaithful cocotte!" laughed one in the crowd, explaining to
      the guards; and they returned to their drinking and dancing, remarking,
      "Beat a woman, and she will love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had all missed the heroism and devotion of Hélène's interference. It
      was to keep a knife out of the body of the man she loved that she smeared
      her lover's face with her blood. We saw her no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to the hall and strolled round the promenade, for we needed
      that to become calm again. And the girls mobbed Bishop, for he had passed
      out the word that he wanted a model, and that he would pay a franc an
      hour. A franc an hour! And so they mobbed him. Was not that more than they
      could hope to earn by a whole day's hard work? Yes, they would all pose
      gladly, but only in costume, bien entendu! So Bishop was busy taking down
      the names of Marcelle, Lorette, Elise, Marie, and the rest, with the names
      of the queer and unheard-of streets in which they lived, mostly in the
      quarters of Montmartre and the Batignolles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The can-can was now raging on the floor, and the tired garçons were
      dodging about with their glassladen trays. Dancing, making love, throwing
      lumps of sugar, the revellers enjoyed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left. The moon cast gaunt shadows across the streets from the old
      windmills and the trees. We struck out briskly, intending to catch the
      last St.-Jacques 'bus home, and with that purpose we threaded the maze of
      steep passages and streets on our way to the Rue Muller. Upon reaching the
      top of the hill, behind the great skeleton of the Sacred Heart, where all
      was silent and still as the grave, we suddenly discovered the shadowy
      figures of men slipping out from a dark little street. We knew what it
      meant. With a common impulse we sprang forward, for it was now a run for
      our lives. I had recognized Crespin in the lead. With headlong speed we
      dashed down the steep incline, swinging our canes to check an attack in
      the rear. We had dodged out of our proper way to the Rue Muller, and now
      it was a matter of speed, endurance, and luck to reach blindly some street
      where life and protection might be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man clutched my coat. I beat him off with my stick, but the skirt of my
      coat was hanging loose, nearly ripped off. A cord went whizzing past me
      and caught Bishop's hat, but he went sturdily on bareheaded. Stones flew
      past us, and presently one caught me a terrific, sickening blow in the
      back. I did not fall, but I staggered in my flight, for a strange
      heaviness came into my legs, and my head soon began to ache violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crespin was desperately active. I could hear him panting heavily as he
      gained upon us. His long shadow, cast by the moon, showed that he was
      about to spring upon Bishop. I swung my cane blindly, but with all my
      might, and it fell upon his head and laid him low; but he quickly
      scrambled to his feet again. The ruffians were now upon us,&mdash;they
      were better used to the hill than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Separate!" gasped Bishop. "It is our only chance." At the next corner we
      suddenly swung apart, taking opposite directions. I plunged on alone, glad
      to hear for a time that footfalls were following,&mdash;they meant that
      the pursuit had not concentrated on Bishop. But after a while I realized
      that I was no longer pursued. I stopped and listened. There was no sound.
      Weak and trembling, with an aching back and a splitting head, I sat down
      in a door-way and rested. That luxury was quickly interrupted by my
      reflecting that possibly Bishop had been overtaken; and I knew what that
      would mean. I ran back up the hill as rapidly as my weakness and trembling
      and pain permitted. At last I found myself at the corner where we had
      separated. There was no sound from any direction. I could only hope for
      the best and search and listen blindly through this puzzle of streets and
      passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I realized that I was near the fortifications of Paris, close to
      St. Ouen,&mdash;that is to say, at the other end of Paris from the
      Quartier Latin, which was eight miles away. There was nothing to do but
      walk home. It was nearly four o'clock when I arrived. And there was Bishop
      in bed, nursing a big lump on his head, made by a flying stone. He had
      reached a street where a gendarme was, and that meant safety; and then he
      had taken a cab for home, where he was looking very ridiculous poulticing
      his lump and making himself sick fretting about me.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EAR the end of a
      recent December Bishop received a note signed "A. Herbert Thomp-kins,"
      written at the Hôtel de l'Athénée, saying that the writer was in Paris for
      four days with his wife before proceeding to Vienna to join some friends.
      It closed by asking, "Could you call at the hotel this evening, say at
      seven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This note created great excitement at our studio early one morning, the
      facteur having climbed six flights of stairs (it being near to New Year)
      to deliver it; for Mr. Thompkins was one of Bishop's warmest friends in
      America. His unexpected arrival in Paris at this unseasonable time of the
      year was indeed a surprise, but a most agreeable one. So Bishop spent the
      whole of the afternoon in creasing his best trousers, ransacking our
      trunks for a clean collar to wear with my blue-fronted shirt, polishing
      his top-hat, and getting his Velasquez whiskers trimmed and perfumed at
      the coiffeur's. It was not every day that friends of Mr. Thompkins's type
      made their appearance in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop, after hours spent in absorbing mental work, at last disclosed his
      plan to me. Of course he would not permit me to keep out of the party, and
      besides, he needed my advice.

    <p>
      Here was Mr. Thompkins in Paris, and unless he were wisely guided he would
      leave without seeing the city,&mdash;except those parts and phases of it
      that tourists cannot keep from stumbling over. It would be both a duty and
      a pleasure to introduce him to certain things of which he might otherwise
      die in ignorance, to the eternal undevelopment of his soul. But here was
      the rub: Would Mr. Thompkins care to be so radically different here for
      one night&mdash;just one night&mdash;from what he was at home? I could not
      see how any harm could come to Mr. Thompkins or any one else with sense,
      nor how Bishop could possibly entertain him in anyway that would be
      disagreeable to a man of brains. But Bishop was evidently keeping
      something back. For that matter, he never did explain it, and I have not
      bothered about inferences. What Mr. Thompkins was at home I do not know.
      True, he was very much confused and embarrassed a number of times during
      the evening, but one thing I know,&mdash;he enjoyed himself immensely. And
      that makes me say that no matter what he was at home, he was a gentleman
      and philosopher while exploring an outlandish phase of Parisian Bohemian
      life that night under our guidance. He had a prim, precise way of talking,
      and was delightfully innocent and unworldly. My! it would have been a sin
      for him to miss what he saw that night. So I told Bishop very emphatically
      that no matter what Mr. Thompkins was at home, nobody who knew him was
      likely to see him in Paris at that time of the year, and that it was
      Bishop's duty as a friend to initiate him. Bishop was very happy over my
      advice; but when he insisted that we should take a cab for the evening's
      outing, I sternly reminded him of the bruises that our funds would receive
      on New Year's, and thus curbed his extravagance. He surrendered with a
      pang, for after all his preparation he felt like a duke, and for that
      night, while entertaining his friend, he wanted to be a duke, not a
      grubbing student.
    </p>
    <p>
      We met Mr. Thompkins at the hotel, and I found him a delightful man, with
      a pleasant sparkle of the eye and a certain stiffness of bearing. It was
      his intention to have us dine with him, but Bishop gently took him in
      hand, and gradually gave him to understand that on this night in a
      lifetime he was in the hands of his friends, to do as they said, and to
      ask no questions. Mr. Thompkins looked a little puzzled, a little
      apprehensive, and withal not unwilling to be sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing we did was to introduce Mr. Thompkins to a quiet
      restaurant famous for its coquilles St.-Jacques; it is in the old Palais
      Royal. This is the dinner that Bishop ordered:
    </p>
    <p>
      Huîtres Portugaises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sauterne. Médoc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consommé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coquilles St.-Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Macaroni à la Milanaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filet de bouf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pommes nouvelles sautées.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crème petit Suisse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eclairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Café.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins's enjoyment of the meal was as generous as his praise of
      Bishop's skill in ordering it, and he declared that the wines particularly
      were a rare treat. By the time that dinner had been finished he was
      enthusiastic about Paris. He said that it was a wonderful city, and that
      he was entirely at our disposal for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose, gentlemen," he suggested, "that you are going to invite me to
      the opera. Now, I have no objections to that, and I am sure I shall be
      delighted,&mdash;it is only one evening in a lifetime, perhaps. But I
      shall insist that you go as my guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop laughed merrily, and slapped his friend on the back in a way that I
      never should have employed with a man of so much dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The opera, old man!" cried Bishop. "Why, you blessed idiot, you act like
      a tourist! The opera! You can go there any time. To-night we shall see
      Paris!" and he laughed again. "The opera!" he repeated. "Oh, my! You can
      fall over the opera whenever you please. This is an opportunity for a tour
      of discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins laughed with equal heartiness, and declared that nothing
      would delight him more than to be an explorer&mdash;for one night in a
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Boul' Mich' or Montmartre?" Bishop whispered to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montmartre," I replied; "Heaven, Death, Hell, and Bruant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the Avenue de l'Opéra appeared so brilliant and lively as on
      that cold, crisp December night, as we strolled towards the boulevards.
      Its thousands of lights, its dashing equipages with the jingling harness
      of horses drawing handsome women and men to the Opéra, its swiftly moving
      cabs and heavy 'buses rolling over the smooth wooden pavement, the shouts
      of drivers and the cracking of whips, the throngs of gay people enjoying
      the holiday attractions, the endless rows of gaudy booths lining the
      street, the flood of light and color everywhere, the cuirassiers of the
      Garde Municipale mounted on superb horses standing motionless in the Place
      de l'Opéra, their long boots and steel breastplates and helmets
      glistening,&mdash;these all had their place,&mdash;while the broad stairs
      of the Opéra were crowded with beautifully gowned women and fashionable
      men pouring in to hear Sibyl Sanderson sing in "Samson and Delilah,"&mdash;all
      this made a wonderful picture of life and beauty, of color, motion,
      vivacity, and enjoyment. Above the entrance to the Opéra red marble
      columns reflected the yellow light of the gilded foyer and of the yellow
      blaze from the Café de la Paix across the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We mounted a Montmartre 'bus and were pulled up the hill to the Boul'
      Clichy, the main artery of that strange Bohemian mountain with its
      eccentric, fantastic, and morbid attractions. Before us, in the Place
      Blanche, stood the great Moulin Rouge, the long skeleton arms of the Red
      Mill marked with red electric lights and slowly sweeping across the
      heavens, while fanciful figures of students and dancing girls looked out
      the windows of the mill, and a great crowd of lively, chatting, laughing
      people were pushing their way toward the entrance of this famous dance-
      hall of Paris. Mr. Thompkins, entranced before the brilliant spectacle,
      asked somewhat hesitatingly if we might enter; but Bishop, wise in the
      ways of Montmartre, replied,&mdash;"Not yet. It is only a little after
      nine, and the Moulin does not get wide awake for some hours yet. We have
      no time to waste while waiting for that. We shall first visit heaven."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins looked surprised, but made no response. Presently we reached
      the gilded gates of Le Cabaret du Ciel. They were bathed in a cold blue
      light from above. Angels, gold-lined clouds, saints, sacred palms and
      plants, and other paraphernalia suggestive of the approach to St. Peter's
      domain, filled all the available space about the entrée. A bold white
      placard, "<i>Bock, i Franc</i>," was displayed in the midst of it all.
      Dolorous church music sounded within, and the heavens were unrolled as a
      scroll in all their tinsel splendor as we entered to the bidding of an
      angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flitting about the room were many more angels, all in white robes and with
      sandals on their feet, and all wearing gauzy wings swaying from their
      shoulder-blades and brass halos above their yellow wigs. These were the
      waiters, the garçons of heaven, ready to take orders for drinks. One of
      these, with the face of a heavy villain in a melodrama and a beard a week
      old, roared unmelodiously,&mdash;"The greetings of heaven to thee,
      brothers! Eternal bliss and happiness are for thee. Mayst thou never
      swerve from its golden paths! Breathe thou its sacred purity and
      renovating exaltation. Prepare to meet thy great Creator&mdash;and don't
      forget the garçon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A very long table covered with white extended the whole length of the
      chilly room, and seated at it, drinking, were scores of candidates for
      angelship,&mdash;mortals like ourselves. Men and women were they, and
      though noisy and vivacious, they indulged in nothing like the abandon of
      the Boul' Mich' <i>café</i>s. Gilded vases and candelabra, together with
      foamy bocks, somewhat relieved the dead whiteness of the table. The
      ceiling was an impressionistic rendering of blue sky, fleecy clouds, and
      stars, and the walls were made to represent the noble enclosure and golden
      gates of paradise.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      "Brothers, your orders! Command me, thy servant!" growled a ferocious
      angel at our elbows, with his accent de la Villette, and his brass halo a
      trifle askew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins had been very quiet, for he was Wonder in the flesh, and
      perhaps there was some distress in his lace, but there was courage also.
      The suddenness of the angel's assault visibly disconcerted him,&mdash;he
      did not know what to order. Finally he decided on a verre de Chartreuse,
      green. Bishop and I ordered bocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two sparkling draughts of heaven's own brew and one star-dazzler!" yelled
      our angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thy will be done," came the response from a hidden bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obscured by great masses of clouds, through whose intervals shone golden
      stars, an organ continually rumbled sacred music, which had a depressing
      rather than a solemn effect, and even the draughts of heaven's own brew
      and the star-dazzler failed to dissipate the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, without the slightest warning, the head of St. Peter, whiskers
      and all, appeared in a hole in the sky, and presently all of him emerged,
      even to his ponderous keys clanging at his girdle. He gazed solemnly down
      upon the crowd at the tables and thoughtfully scratched his left wing.
      From behind a dark cloud he brought forth a vessel of white crockery
      (which was not a wash-bowl) containing (ostensibly) holy water. After
      several mysterious signs and passes with his bony hands he generously
      sprinkled the sinners below with a brush dipped in the water; and then,
      with a parting blessing, he slowly faded into mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever? Well, well, I declare!" exclaimed Mr. Thompkins,
      breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>

      The royal cortège of the kingdom of heaven was now forming at one end of
      the room before a shrine, whereon an immense golden pig sat sedately on
      his haunches, looking friendly and jovial, his loose skin and fat jowls
      hanging in folds. Lighted candles sputtered about his golden sides. As the
      participants in the pageant, all attachés of the place, formed for the
      procession, each bowed reverently and crossed himself before the huge
      porker. A small man, dressed in a loose black gown and black skull- cap,
      evidently made up for Dante, whom he resembled, officiated as master of
      ceremonies. He mounted a golden pulpit, and delivered, in a loud, rasping
      voice, a tedious discourse on heaven and allied things. He dwelt on the
      attractions of heaven as a perpetual summer resort, an unbroken round of
      pleasures in variety, where sweet strains of angelic music (indicating the
      wheezy organ), together with unlimited stores of heaven's own sparkling
      fire of life, at a franc a bock, and beautiful goldenhaired cherubs, of la
      Villette's finest, lent grace and perfection to the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0087" id="linkimage-0087"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      The parade then began its tour about the room, Dante, carrying a staff
      surmounted by a golden bull, serving as drum-major. Angel musicians,
      playing upon sacred lyres and harps, followed in his wake, but the
      dolorous organ made the more noise. Behind the lyre angels came a number
      of the notables whom Dante immortalized,&mdash;at least, we judged that
      they were so intended. The angel garçons closed the cortège, their gauzy
      wings and brass halos bobbing in a stately fashion as they strode along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angel garçons now sauntered up and gave us each a ticket admitting us
      to the angel-room and the other delights of the inner heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youarre Eengleesh?" he asked. "Yes? Ah, theece Eengleesh arre verra
      genereauz," eyeing his fifty-centime tip with a questioning shrug. "Can
      you not make me un franc? Ah, eet ees dam cold in theece laigs," pointing
      to his calves, which were encased in diaphanous pink tights. He got his
      franc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dante announced in his rasping voice that those mortals wishing to become
      angels should proceed up to the angel-room. All advanced and ascended the
      inclined passage-way leading into the blue. At the farther end of the
      passage sat old St. Peter, solemn and shivering, for it was draughty there
      among the clouds. He collected our tickets, gave the password admitting us
      to the inner precincts, and resented Bishop's attempts to pluck a feather
      from his wings. We entered a large room, all a glamour of gold and silver.
      The walls were studded with blazing nuggets, colored canvas rocks, and
      electric lights. We took seats on wooden benches fronting a cleft in the
      rocks, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the chamber in which we sat became perfectly dark, the cleft before
      us shining with a dim bluish light. The cleft then came to life with a
      bevy of female angels floating through the limited ethereal space, and
      smiling down upon us mortals. One of the lady angel's tights bagged at the
      knees, and another's wings were not on straight; but this did not
      interfere with her flight, any more than did the stationary position of
      the wings of all. But it was all very easily and gracefully done, swooping
      down, soaring, and swinging in circles like so many great eagles. They
      seemed to discover something of unusual interest in Mr. Thompkins, for
      they singled him out to throw kisses at him. This made him blush and
      fidget, but a word from Bishop reassured him,&mdash;it was only once in a
      lifetime!
    </p>
    <p>
      After these angels had gyrated for some time, the head angel of the
      angel-room requested those who desired to become angels to step forward. A
      number responded, among them some of the naughty dancing-girls of the
      Moulin Rouge. They were conducted through a concealed door, and presently
      we beheld them soaring in the empyrean just as happy and serene as though
      they were used to being angels. It was a marvel to see wings so frail
      transport with so much ease a very stout young woman from the audience,
      and their being fully clothed did not seem to make any difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins had sat in a singularly contemplative mood after the real
      angels had quit torturing him, and surprised us beyond measure by promptly
      responding to a second call for those aspiring to angelhood. He
      disappeared with another batch from the Moulin Rouge, and soon afterwards
      we saw him floating like an airship. He even wore his hat. To his disgust
      and chagrin, however, one of the concert-hall angels persisted in flying
      in front of him and making violent love to him. This brought forth
      tumultuous applause and laughter, which completed Mr. Thompkins's misery.
      At this juncture the blue cleft became dark, the angel-room burst into
      light, and soon Mr. Thompkins rejoined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we filed out into the passage Father Time stood with long whiskers and
      scythe, greeted us with profound bows, and promised that his scythe would
      spare us for many happy years did we but drop sous into his hour- glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no conversation among us when we emerged upon the boulevard, for
      Mr. Thompkins was in a retrospective frame of mind. Bishop embraced the
      opportunity to lead us up the Boulevard Clichy to the Place Pigalle. As we
      neared the Place we saw on the opposite side of the street two flickering
      iron lanterns that threw a ghastly green light down upon the barred
      dead-black shutters of the building, and caught the faces of the
      passers-by with sickly rays that took out all the life and transformed
      them into the semblance of corpses. Across the top of the closed black
      entrance were large white letters, reading simply: "<i>Cafe du Néant</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance was heavily draped with black cerements, having white
      trimmings,&mdash;such as hang before the houses of the dead in Paris. Here
      patrolled a solitary croque-mort, or hired pall-bearer, his black cape
      drawn closely about him, the green light reflected by his glazed top- hat.
      A more dismal and forbidding place it would be difficult to imagine. Mr.
      Thompkins paled a little when he discovered that this was our destination,&mdash;this
      grisly caricature of eternal nothingness,&mdash;and hesitated at the
      threshold. Without a word Bishop firmly took his arm and entered. The
      lonely croque-mort drew apart the heavy curtain and admitted us into a
      black hole that proved later to be a room. The chamber was dimly lighted
      with wax tapers, and a large chandelier intricately devised of human
      skulls and arms, with funeral candles held in their fleshless fingers,
      gave its small quota of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Large, heavy, wooden coffins, resting on biers, were ranged about the room
      in an order suggesting the recent happening of a frightful catastrophe.
      The walls were decorated with skulls and bones, skeletons in grotesque
      attitudes, battle-pictures, and guillotines in action. Death, carnage,
      assassination were the dominant note, set in black hangings and
      illuminated with mottoes on death. A half-dozen voices droned this in a
      low monotone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter, mortals of this sinful world, enter into the mists and shadows of
      eternity. Select your biers, to the right, to the left; fit yourselves
      comfortably to them, and repose in the solemnity and tranquillity of
      death; and may God have mercy on your souls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of persons who had preceded us had already pre-empted their
      coffins, and were sitting beside them awaiting developments and enjoying
      their consommations, using the coffins for their real purpose,&mdash;tables
      for holding drinking-glasses. Alongside the glasses were slender tapers by
      which the visitors might see one another.

      There seemed to be no mechanical imperfection in the illusion of a
      charnel-house; we imagined that even chemistry had contributed its
      resources, for there seemed distinctly to be the odor appropriate to such
      a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found a vacant coffin in the vault, seated ourselves at it on rush-
      bottomed stools, and awaited further developments.

    <p>
      Another croque-mort&mdash;a garçon he was&mdash;came up through the gloom
      to take our orders. He was dressed completely in the professional garb of
      a hearse-follower, including claw-hammer coat, full-dress front, glazed
      tile, and oval silver badge. He droned,&mdash;"<i>Bon soir, Macchabées! *
      Buvez les crachats d'asthmatiques, voilà des sueurs froides d'agonisants.
      Prenez donc des certificats de décès, seulement vingt sous. C'est pas cher
      et c'est artistique!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      * This word (also Maccabe, argot Macabit) is given in Paris by sailors to
      cadavers found floating in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop said that he would be pleased with a lowly bock. Mr. Thompkins
      chose cherries à l'eau-de-vie, and I, une menthe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One microbe of Asiatic cholera from the last corpse, one leg of a lively
      cancer, and one sample of our consumption germ!" moaned the creature
      toward a black hole at the farther end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some women among the visitors tittered, others shuddered, and Mr.
      Thompkins broke out in a cold sweat on his brow, while a curious
      accompaniment of anger shone in his eyes. Our sleepy pallbearer soon
      loomed through the darkness with our deadly microbes, and waked the echoes
      in the hollow casket upon which he set the glasses with a thump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink, Macchabées!" he wailed: "drink these noxious potions, which
      contain the vilest and deadliest poisons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The villain!" gasped Mr. Thompkins; "it is horrible, disgusting, filthy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tapers flickered feebly on the coffins, and the white skulls grinned
      at him mockingly from their sable background. Bishop exhausted all his
      tactics in trying to induce Mr. Thompkins to taste his bran-died cherries,
      but that gentleman positively refused,&mdash;he seemed unable to banish
      the idea that they were laden with disease germs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had been seated here for some time, getting no consolation from
      the utter absence of spirit and levity among the other guests, and
      enjoying only the dismay and trepidation of new and strange arrivals, a
      rather good-looking young fellow, dressed in a black clerical coat, came
      through a dark door and began to address the assembled patrons. His voice
      was smooth, his manner solemn and impressive, as he delivered a
      well-worded discourse on death. He spoke of it as the gate through which
      we must all make our exit from this world,&mdash;of the gloom, the
      loneliness, the utter sense of helplessness and desolation. As he warmed
      to his subject he enlarged upon the follies that hasten the advent of
      death, and spoke of the relentless certainty and the incredible variety of
      ways in which the reaper claims his victims. Then he passed on to the
      terrors of actual dissolution, the tortures of the body, the rending of
      the soul, the unimaginable agonies that sensibilities rendered acutely
      susceptible at this extremity are called upon to endure. It required good
      nerves to listen to that, for the man was perfect in his rôle. From
      matters of individual interest in death he passed to death in its larger
      aspects. He pointed to a large and striking battle scene, in which the
      combatants had come to hand-to-hand fighting, and were butchering one
      another in a mad lust for blood. Suddenly the picture began to glow, the
      light bringing out its ghastly details with hideous distinctness. Then as
      suddenly it faded away, and where fighting men had been there were
      skeletons writhing and struggling in a deadly embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar effect was produced with a painting giving a wonderfully
      realistic representation of an execution by the guillotine. The bleeding
      trunk of the victim lying upon the flap-board dissolved, the flesh slowly
      disappearing, leaving only the white bones. Another picture, representing
      a brilliant dance-hall filled with happy revellers, slowly merged into a
      grotesque dance of skeletons; and thus it was with the other pictures
      about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this being done, the master of ceremonies, in lugubrious tones,
      invited us to enter the chambre de la mort. All the visitors rose, and,
      bearing each a taper, passed in single file into a narrow, dark passage
      faintly illuminated with sickly green lights, the young man in clerical
      garb acting as pilot. The cross effects of green and yellow lights on the
      faces of the groping procession were more startling than picturesque. The
      way was lined with bones, skulls, and fragments of human bodies.

      "O Macchabées, nous sommes devant la porte de la chambre de la mort!"
      wailed an unearthly voice from the farther end of the passage as we
      advanced. Then before us appeared a solitary figure standing beneath a
      green lamp. The figure was completely shrouded in black, only the eyes
      being visible, and they shone through holes in the pointed cowl. From the
      folds of the gown it brought forth a massive iron key attached to a chain,
      and, approaching a door seemingly made of iron and heavily studded with
      spikes and crossed with bars, inserted and turned the key; the bolts moved
      with a harsh, grating noise, and the door of the chamber of death swung
      slowly open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Macchabées, enter into eternity, whence none ever return!" cried the
      new, strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the room were a dead and unrelieved black. At one side two
      tall candles were burning, but their feeble light was insufficient even to
      disclose the presence of the black walls of the chamber or indicate that
      anything but unending blackness extended heavenward. There was not a thing
      to catch and reflect a single ray of the light and thus become visible in
      the blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the two candles was an upright opening in the wall; it was of the
      shape of a coffin. We were seated upon rows of small black caskets resting
      on the floor in front of the candles. There was hardly a whisper among the
      visitors. The black-hooded figure passed silently out of view and vanished
      in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a pale, greenish-white illumination began to light up the
      coffin-shaped hole in the wall, clearly marking its outline against the
      black. Within this space there stood a coffin upright, in which a pretty
      young woman, robed in a white shroud, fitted snugly. Soon it was evident
      that she was very much alive, for she smiled and looked at us saucily. But
      that was not for long. From the depths came a dismal wail:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Macchabée, beautiful, breathing mortal, pulsating with the warmth and
      richness of life, thou art now in the grasp of death! Compose thy soul for
      the end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face slowly became white and rigid; her eyes sank; her lips tightened
      across her teeth; her cheeks took on the hollowness of death,&mdash; she
      was dead. But it did not end with that. From white the face slowly grew
      livid... then purplish black.... The eyes visibly shrank into their
      greenish-yellow sockets.... Slowly the hair fell away.... The nose melted
      away into a purple putrid spot. The whole face became a semi- liquid mass
      of corruption. Presently all this had disappeared, and a gleaming skull
      shone where so recently had been the handsome face of a woman; naked teeth
      grinned inanely and savagely where rosy lips had so recently smiled. Even
      the shroud had gradually disappeared, and an entire skeleton stood
      revealed in the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wail again rang through the silent vault:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah, Macchabée! Thou hast reached the last stage of dissolution, so
      dreadful to mortals. The work that follows death is complete. But despair
      not, for death is not the end of all. The power is given to those who
      merit it, not only to return to life, but to return in any form and
      station preferred to the old. So return if thou deservedst and desirest."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0091" id="linkimage-0091"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0280.jpg" alt="0280 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0280.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      With a slowness equal to that of the dissolution, the bones became covered
      with flesh and cerements, and all the ghastly steps were reproduced
      reversed. Gradually the sparkle of the eyes began to shine through the
      gloom; but when the reformation was completed, behold! there was no longer
      the handsome and smiling young woman, but the sleek, rotund body, ruddy
      cheeks, and self-conscious look of a banker. It was not until this touch
      of comedy relieved the strain that the rigidity with which Mr. Thompkins
      had sat between us began to relax, and a smile played over his face,&mdash;a
      bewildered, but none the less a pleasant, smile. The prosperous banker
      stepped forth, sleek and tangible, and haughtily strode away before our
      eyes, passing through the audience into the darkness. Again was the
      coffin-shaped hole in the wall dark and empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He of the black gown and pointed hood now emerged through an invisible
      door, and asked if there was any one in the audience who desired to pass
      through the experience that they had just witnessed. This created a
      suppressed commotion; each peered into the face of his neighbor to find
      one with courage sufficient for the ordeal. Bishop suggested to Mr.
      Thompkins in a whisper that he submit himself, but that gentleman very
      peremptorily declined. Then, after a pause, Bishop stepped forth and
      announced that he was prepared to die. He was asked solemnly by the
      doleful person if he was ready to accept all the consequences of his
      decision. He replied that he was. Then he disappeared through the black
      wall, and presently appeared in the greenish-white light of the open
      coffin. There he composed himself as he imagined a corpse ought, crossed
      his hands upon his breast, suffered the white shroud to be drawn about
      him, and awaited results,&mdash;after he had made a rueful grimace that
      threw the first gleam of suppressed merriment through the oppressed
      audience. He passed through all the ghastly stages that the former
      occupant of the coffin had experienced, and returned in proper person to
      life and to his seat beside Mr. Thompkins, the audience applauding softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mysterious figure in black waylaid the crowd as it filed out. He held an
      inverted skull, into which we were expected to drop sous through the
      natural opening there, and it was with the feeling of relief from a heavy
      weight that we departed and turned our backs on the green lights at the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a wonderful contrast! Here we were in the free, wide, noisy,
      brilliant world again. Here again were the crowds, the venders, saucy
      grisettes with their bright smiles, shining teeth, and alluring glances.
      Here again were the bustling <i>café</i>s, the music, the lights, the
      life, and above all the giant arms of the Moulin Rouge sweeping the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," quietly remarked Bishop, "having passed through death, we will
      explore hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins seemed too weak, or unresisting, or apathetic to protest.
      His face betrayed a queer mixture of emotions, part suffering, part
      revulsion, part a sort of desperate eagerness for more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We passed through a large, hideous, fanged, open mouth in an enormous face
      from which shone eyes of blazing crimson. Curiously enough, it adjoined
      heaven, whose cool blue lights contrasted strikingly with the fierce
      ruddiness of hell. Red-hot bars and gratings through which flaming coals
      gleamed appeared in the walls within the red mouth. A placard announced
      that should the temperature of this inferno make one thirsty, innumerable
      bocks might be had at sixty-five centimes each. A little red imp guarded
      the throat of the monster into whose mouth we had walked; he was cutting
      extraordinary capers, and made a great show of stirring the fires. The red
      imp opened the imitation heavy metal door for our passage to the interior,
      crying,&mdash;"Ah, ah, ah! still they come! Oh, how they will roast!" Then
      he looked keenly at Mr. Thompkins. It was interesting to note how that
      gentleman was always singled out by these shrewd students of humanity.
      This particular one added with great gusto, as he narrowly studied Mr.
      Thompkins, "Hist! ye infernal whelps; stir well the coals and heat red the
      prods, for this is where we take our revenge on earthly saintliness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter and be damned,&mdash;the Evil One awaits you!" growled a chorus of
      rough voices as we hesitated before the scene confronting us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near us was suspended a caldron over a fire, and hopping within it were
      half a dozen devil musis dans, male and female, playing a selection from
      "Faust" on stringed instruments, while red imps stood by, prodding with
      red-hot irons those who lagged in their performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crevices in the walls of this room ran with streams of molten gold and
      silver, and here and there were caverns lit up by smouldering fires from
      which thick smoke issued, and vapors emitting the odors of a volcano.
      Flames would suddenly burst from clefts in the rocks, and thunder rolled
      through the caverns. Red imps were everywhere, darting about noiselessly,
      some carrying beverages for the thirsty lost souls, others stirring the
      fires or turning somersaults. Everything was in a high state of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous red tables stood against the fiery walls; at these sat the
      visitors. Mr. Thompkins seated himself at one of them. Instantly it became
      aglow with a mysterious light, which kept flaring up and disappearing in
      an erratic fashion; flames darted from the walls, fires crackled and
      roared. One of the imps came to take our order; it was for three coffees,
      black, with cognac; and this is how he shrieked the order:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three seething bumpers of molten sins, with a dash of brimstone
      intensifier!" Then, when he had brought it, "This will season your
      intestines, and render them invulnerable, for a time at least, to the
      tortures of the melted iron that will be soon poured down your throats."
      The glasses glowed with a phosphorescent light. "Three francs seventy-
      five, please, not counting me. Make it four francs. Thank you well.
      Remember that though hell is hot, there are cold drinks if you want them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Satan himself strode into the cavern, gorgeous in his imperial
      robe of red, decked with blazing jewels, and brandishing a sword from
      which fire flashed. His black moustaches were waxed into sharp points, and
      turned rakishly upward above lips upon which a sneering grin appeared.
      Thus he leered at the new arrivals in his domain. His appearance lent new
      zest to the activity of the imps and musicians, and all cowered under his
      glance. Suddenly he burst into a shrieking laugh that gave one a creepy
      feeling. It rattled through the cavern with a startling effect as he
      strode up and down. It was a triumphant, cruel, merciless laugh. All at
      once he paused in front of a demure young Parisienne seated at a table
      with her escort, and, eying her keenly, broke into this speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you! Why do you tremble? How many men have you sent hither to
      damnation with those beautiful eyes, those rosy, tempting lips? Ah, for
      all that, you have found a sufficient hell on earth. But you," he added,
      turning fiercely upon her escort, "you will have the finest, the most
      exquisite tortures that await the damned. For what? For being a fool. It
      is folly more than crime that hell punishes, for crime is a disease and
      folly a sin. You fool! For thus hanging upon the witching glance and oily
      words of a woman you have filled all hell with fuel for your roasting. You
      will suffer such tortures as only the fool invites, such tortures only as
      are adequate to punish folly. Prepare for the inconceivable, the
      unimaginable, the things that even the king of hell dare not mention lest
      the whole structure of damnation totter and crumble to dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man winced, and queer wrinkles came into the corners of his mouth.
      Then Satan happened to discover Mr. Thompkins, who shrank visibly under
      the scorching gaze. Satan made a low, mocking bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do me great honor, sir," he declared, unctuously. "You may have been
      expecting to avoid me, but reflect upon what you would have missed! We
      have many notables here, and you will have charming society. They do not
      include pickpockets and thieves, nor any others of the weak, stunted,
      crippled, and halting. You will find that most of your companions are
      distinguished gentlemen of learning and ability, who, knowing their duty,
      failed to perform it. You will be in excellent company, sir," he
      concluded, with another low bow. Then, suddenly turning and sweeping the
      room with a gesture, he commanded, "To the hot room, all of you!" while he
      swung his sword, from which flashes of lightning trailed and thunder
      rumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were led to the end of a passage, where a red-hot iron door barred
      further progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh, within there!" roared Satan. "Open the portal of the hot chamber,
      that these fresh arrivals may be introduced to the real temperature of
      hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0093" id="linkimage-0093"> </a>

    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      After numerous signals and mysterious passes the door swung open, and we
      entered. It was not so very hot after all. The chamber resembled the
      other, except that a small stage occupied one end. A large green snake
      crawled out upon this, and suddenly it was transformed into a red devil
      with exceedingly long, thin legs, encased in tights that were ripped in
      places. He gave some wonderful contortion feats. A poor little white
      Pierrot came on and assisted the red devil in black art performances. By
      this time we discovered that in spite of the halfmolten condition of the
      rock-walls, the room was disagreeably chilly. And that ended our
      experience in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop then led us to the closed, dark front of a house in front of which
      stood a suspicious-looking man, who eyed us contemptuously. Bishop told
      him that we should like to enter. The man assented with a growl. He beat
      upon the door with a stick; a little wicket opened, and a villanous face
      peered out at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?" came from it in gruff tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To enter, of course," responded Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they, all right, do you think?" asked the face of the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think they are harmless," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several bolts and locks grated, and the stubborn door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter, you vile specimens of human folly!" hissed the inside guard as we
      passed within. "D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;all three of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We had no sooner found ourselves inside than this same person, a short,
      stout man, with long hair and a powerful frame, and the face of a
      cutthroat, struck a table with the heavy stick that he carried, and roared
      to us,&mdash;"Sit down!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins involuntarily cowered, but he gathered himself up and went
      with us to seats at the nearest table. While we were doing this the
      habitués of the place greeted us with this song, sung in chorus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Oh, là là! c'te gueule&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      C'te binette.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Oh, là là, c'te gueule,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Qu'il a."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they saying?" asked Mr. Thompkins; but Bishop spared him by
      explaining that it was only the latest song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0094" id="linkimage-0094"> </a>

    <p>
      The room had a low ceiling crossed by heavy beams. Wrought-iron gas lamps
      gave a gloomy light upon the dark, time-browned color of the place. The
      beams were loaded with dust, cobwebs, and stains, the result of years of
      smoke and accumulation. Upon the walls were dozens of drawings by
      Steinlen, illustrating the poems of low life written by the proprietor of
      the <i>café</i>; for we were in the den of the famous Aristide Bruant, the
      poet of the gutter,&mdash;Verlaine had a higher place as the poet of the
      slums. There were also drawings by Chéret, Willett, and others, and some
      clever sketches in oil; the whole effect was artistic. In one corner was
      an old fireplace, rich in carvings of grotesque heads and figures, grilled
      iron-work, and shining copper vessels. The general impression was of a
      mediaeval gun-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the fireplace, upon a low platform, was a piano; grouped about it
      were four typical Bohemians of lower Bohemia; they wore loads of hair;
      their faces had a dissipated look, their fingers were heavily stained by
      cigarettes; they wore beards and négligé black cravats. These were all
      minor poets, and they took their turn in singing or reciting their own
      compositions, afterwards making a tour of the crowded tables with a tin
      cup and collecting the sous upon which they lived, and roundly cursing
      those who refused to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop was so delighted with the pictures on the walls that he proceeded
      to examine them, but the bully with the stick thundered,&mdash;"Sit down!"
      and shook his bludgeon menacingly. Bishop sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the brute swaggered up to us and demanded,&mdash;"What the devil do
      you want to drink, anyway? Speak up quick!" When he had brought the drinks
      he gruffly demanded, "Pay up!" Upon receiving the customary tip he
      frowned, glared at us with a threatening manner, and growled, "Humph! <i>c'est
      pas beaucoup!</i>" and swept the money into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness! this is an awful place!" exclaimed Mr. Thompkins under his
      breath. He seemed to fear being brained at any moment. Retreat had been
      rendered impossible by the locking of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were prisoners at the will of our jailer, and so were all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Bruant himself sat with a party of congenial Bohemians at a
      table near the piano and fireplace; they were drinking bocks and smoking
      cigarettes and long-stemmed pipes. On the wall behind them was a rack
      holding the pipes of the habitués of the <i>café</i>, mostly broken and
      well browned. Each pipe was owned by a particular Bohemian, and each had
      its special place in the rack. The other tables held a general assortment
      of lesser Bohemians and sight-seers, all cowed and silent under the
      domination of the bawling ruffian with the stick. Whenever he smiled
      (which was rare, a perpetual frown having creased a deep furrow between
      his eyes) they smiled also, in great relief, and hung upon every word that
      his occasional lapses into an approach to good nature permitted him to
      utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poets and singers howled their productions in rasping voices, and put
      a strain upon the strength of the piano; and the minor Bohemians applauded
      them heartily and envied them their distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this performance there came a knock upon the door. The
      bully walked up to the wicket, peered out, and admitted an elderly
      gentleman, accompanied by a lady, evidently his wife. These the habitués
      greeted with the following song:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Tout les clients sont des cochons&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      La faridon, la faridon donne.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Et surtout les ceux qui s'en vont&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      La faridon, la faridon donne."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, somewhat abashed by this reception, hesitated a moment,
      then sought seats. The two had hardly seated themselves when the burly
      ruffian with the stick began to recite a villanous poem reflecting upon
      the chastity of married women, emphasizing it with atrocious side remarks.
      The gentleman sprang from his seat in a rage and advanced threateningly
      upon the brute, who stood leering at him and taking a firmer hold upon his
      stick; but the visitor's wife caught the outraged man by the arm and
      restrained him. A wordy war ensued (for the gentleman was a Frenchman), in
      which the choicest argot of Montmartre and La Villette was exhausted by
      the ruffian. He closed by shouting,&mdash;"You were not invited to enter
      here. You asked the privilege of entering; your wish was granted. If you
      don't like it here, get out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman flung down a franc upon the table, the bolts were withdrawn,
      and he and his wife passed out while the roysterers sang,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Tout les clients sont des cochons," etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      amid the laughter of the smaller Bohemians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristide Bruant now rose from his table and strode to the centre of the
      room. A perfect silence fell. He is rather a small man, slender, and of
      delicate build; he has a thin, sallow face, with piercing black eyes,
      prominent cheek-bones, and long raven-black hair falling over his
      shoulders from beneath a broad black slouch hat down over his eyes. His
      unbuttoned coat showed a red flannel shirt open at the throat; a broad
      sash was about his waist; his trousers were tucked into top-boots,&mdash;the
      ensemble reminding one of Buffalo Bill. He glared sullenly round upon the
      people, and then sprang lightly upon a table. From that perch he recited
      one of his poems, selected from his book of songs and monologues. It does
      not bear reproduction here. For that matter, being written in the argot of
      Montmartre, it could hardly be understood even by French scholars
      unfamiliar with Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily Mr. Thompkins understood not a word of it, smiling perfunctorily
      out of politeness while Bruant was uttering things that might have shocked
      the most hardened Parisians. There were several young women present, and
      while Bruant was reciting they ogled him with genuine adoration. The other
      poets hung reverently upon his every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mighty burst of applause greeted the finish of the recitation; but
      Bruant slouched indifferently to his seat, ignoring the ovation. The bully
      with the stick immediately stopped the noise by yelling, "Silence!" This
      he followed up with the contribution-cup for the benefit of the idol of
      Montmartre. With the cup he brought the volume of Bruant's poems from
      which he had given the recitation,&mdash;a cheaply printed pamphlet. No
      one dared refuse to buy, and no change was returned. Was not this the
      great Aristide Bruant, the immortal of Montmartre?

      He was followed by other poets with songs and the banging of the piano. We
      presently rose to leave, but the bully shouted,&mdash;"Sit down! How dare
      you insult the young poet who is now singing?" We submissively resumed our
      seats. After a while, in a lull, we respectfully rose again, and the
      bully, shouting, "Get out!" unbarred the door and we were free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins was more deeply puzzled than he had been before that night.
      He could not understand that such a resort, where one is bullied and
      insulted, could secure patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is Paris, Mr. Thompkins," explained Bishop, somewhat vaguely;
      "and this particular part of Paris is Montmartre."
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight was now close at hand, but Montmartre was in the height of its
      gayety. Students, Bohemians, and cocottes were skipping and singing along
      the boulevard,&mdash;singing the songs of Bruant. The <i>café</i>s were
      crowded, the theatres and concert halls only in the middle of their
      programmes. Cabs were dashing about, some stopping at the Moulin Rouge,
      others at the Elysée Montmartre, still others picking up fares for more
      distant attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop halted in front of a quiet-looking house with curtained windows,
      and bluntly asked Mr. Thompkins if he would like to go to church. Mr.
      Thompkins caught his breath, and an odd, guilty look came into his face.
      But before he could make reply Bishop was leading the way within. The
      interior of the place certainly looked like a church,&mdash;it was fitted
      to have that significance. The cold, gray stone walls rose to a vaulted
      Gothic ceiling; Gothic pillars and arches and carved wood completed the
      architectural effect; statues of saints appeared in niches, some
      surmounted by halos of lighted candles; and there were banners bearing
      scriptural mottoes.

    <p>
      The heavy oaken tables on the floor were provided with stiff, high- backed
      pulpit-chairs, beautiful in color and carving, and of a Gothic type, the
      whole scene suggesting a transept of Notre-Dame. Mr. Thomp- kins had
      reverently removed his hat. It was not long afterward that he quietly
      replaced it on his head. No notice was taken by us of these movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end, where the church altar belonged, was indeed a
      handsomely carved altar. Above it sprang a graceful arch, bearing a canopy
      beautifully painted in blue, with yellow stars. In the centre was a
      painting of Christ upon the cross. The altar was the bar, or caisse, of
      this queer <i>café</i>, and behind it sat the proprietress, quietly
      knitting and waiting to fill orders for drinks. The walls of the <i>café</i>
      were almost entirely covered with framed drawings by Rodel; all were
      portraits of well-known Bohemians of Montmartre in characteristic
      attitudes,&mdash;the star patrons of this rendezvous. Many women figured
      among them, all Bohemian to the bone.

      This was the Café du Conservatoire, famous for its celebrities, the poets
      of Bohemian Paris, among whom Marcel Legay is eminent. It was evident that
      the habitués of the Conservatoire were of a much higher order than those
      whom we had seen elsewhere.

      They looked more prosperous, were more amiable, and acted more as other
      people.

    <p>
      True, there was much long hair, for that is a disease hard to shake off;
      but when it did occur, it was well combed and oiled. And there were many
      flat-brimmed "plug" hats, as well as collars,&mdash;clean ones, too, an
      exceptional thing in Bohemia, laundering being expensive. But the
      poverty-haunted Bohemians in the Soleil d'Or are more picturesque. That,
      however, is in the Latin Quarter: anything exceptional may be expected at
      Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had finished our coffee we approached the patronne behind the bar,
      and bought billets for the Salle des Poètes at two francs each. This was a
      large room crowded with enraptured listeners to Legay, who was at that
      moment rendering his song.

      Legay had quite a distinguished appearance as he stood singing before the
      piano. He wore a generously cut frock-coat, and his waistcoat exposed a
      spacious show of white shirt-front.

      His long hair was carefully brushed back, his moustaches neatly waxed;
      altogether he was dainty and jaunty, and the ladies in the room made no
      concealment of their adoration.

      The accompanist was a picturesque character. He was forty-five or fifty
      years of age; he had long white hair and a drooping moustache, and his
      heavy protruding eyes were suffused with tears evoked by the pathos of the
      song. While he gazed up into the singer's face with tear-filled eyes he
      was in another life, another world, where there was nothing but music and
      poetry unalloyed to constitute his heaven. For Legay sang charmingly, with
      an art and a feeling that were never obtrusive; and his audience was
      aesthetic. When he had finished he was cheered without stint, and he
      clearly showed how much the attention pleased him.

      His song was only one of the numbers on a very interesting programme. This
      was the training school of the young poets and song-writers of upper
      Bohemia; this was where they made their début and met the test of that
      discriminating criticism which decided them to advance upon the world or
      conceal themselves for yet a while from its cruel glare; and were they not
      but repeating the ordeal of the ancient Greeks, out of which so many noble
      things passed into literature? These critics were as frank with their
      disapproval as generous with their acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who sang were Gustave Corbet, Marius Geffroy, Eugene
      Lemercier, Xavier Privas, Delarbre, and Henri Brallet, men as yet unknown,
      but likely to make a mark under the training, inspiration, and severe
      checks of the Café du Conservatoire. One of the goals for which these
      writers strive, and one that, if they win it, means to them recognition,
      is to have their poems published in <i>Gil Blas</i>, with illustrations by
      the peerless Steinlen, as are the works of Legay, and also of Bruant, le
      Terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcel Legay is a familiar figure on the boulevards, where his dainty
      person is often seen after nightfall, hurrying to one or another of his
      haunts, with a small roll of music under his arm, and his fluffy hair
      streaming over his shoulders. On certain nights of every week he sings
      over in the Latin Quarter, at the Cabaret des Noctambules, Rue
      Champollion, near the Chapel of the Sorbonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other singers that night at the Café du Conservatoire each affected
      his peculiar style of habit, gesture, and pose that he deemed most
      fetching. The entire programme was of songs: hence the name, Café du
      Conservatoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had deft, Bishop bought some Brevas cigars; thus fortified, we
      headed for the Moulin Rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Mr. Thompkins had reserved his enthusiasm for the
      great dance-hall of Montmartre,&mdash;Le Moulin Rouge,&mdash;with its
      women of the half world, its giddiness, its glare, its noise, its
      naughtiness.

      Here at last we should find all absence of restraint, posing, sordidness,
      self-consciousness, and appeals to abnormal appetites. Mr. Thompkins
      visibly brightened as we ascended the incline of the entrance and came
      within the influence of the life and abandon of the place. Indeed, it must
      have seemed like fairy-land to him. The soft glow of hundreds of lights
      fell upon the crowds in the ball-room and balconies, with their shifting
      streams of color from the moving figures of dancing women in showy gowns
      and saucy hats, and its many chatting, laughing, joyous groups at the
      tables along the passage and the balconies, enjoying merry little suppers
      and varied consommations that kept scores of garçons continually on the
      move. A placard announced American Bar; American and English Drinks&mdash;as
      bald and unashamed as that. Here on high stools, American free-lunch
      fashion, ranged along the bar, were English and American tourists and
      French dandies sipping Manhattan cocktails with a cherry, brandy-and-soda,
      Tom-and-Jerry, and the rest. Along the walls hung vivid paintings of some
      of the famous dancing-girls of the Moulin, their saucy faces half hidden
      in clouds of lacy white skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      High up on a pretty balcony at the end of the huge ball-room were the
      musicians, enjoying their cigarettes and bocks between pieces. A small
      stage occupied the opposite end of the room, where a light vaudeville
      performance had been given; but that was all over now, and attention
      centred in the tables and the dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moulin Rouge resembles very much the Bul-lier; but at the Moulin the
      cocottes are much more dashing and gaudy than over in the Quartier,
      because the inspector at the door of the Moulin maintains a more exacting
      standard on the score of the toilettes of the women whom he admits free of
      charge. Women, women, women! There seemed no end of them; and each was
      arrayed to the full limit of her means. And there were French dandies in
      long-white melton coats that were very tight at the waist, and that bore
      large brown-velvet collars; their hair, parted behind, was brushed toward
      their ears; they strolled about the place in numbers, twirling their
      moustaches and ogling the girls. And there were French army officers,
      Martinique negroes, longhaired students and Montmartre poets, artists,
      actors, and many three-days-in-Paris English tourists wearing
      knickerbockers and golf-caps, and always smoking bulldog pipes. There were
      also two parties of American men with their wives and daughters, and they
      enjoyed the spectacle with the natural fulness and responsiveness of their
      soil. For the Moulin is really now but a great show place; it has been
      discovered by the outside world, and, unlike the other quaint places
      mentioned in this paper, has suffered the change that such contact
      inevitably imparts. It is no longer the queer old Moulin, genuinely,
      spontaneously Bohemian. But the stranger would hardly realize that; and so
      to Mr. Thompkins it seemed the brilliant and showy side of Bohemian Paris.
      By reason of its change in character it has less interest than the real
      Bohemian Paris that the real Bohemians know, enjoy, and jealously guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many light-footed young women were amusing circles of on-lookers with
      spirited dancing and reckless high-kicking; and, being adepts in their
      peculiar art, were so flashing and illusory that an attempt to analyze
      their movements brought only bewilderment. No bones seemed to hamper their
      swiftness and elasticity. The flash of a black stocking would instantly
      dissolve into a fleecy cloud of lace, and the whirling air was a cyclone;
      and there upon the floor sat the dancer in the "split," looking up with a
      merry laugh, flushed cheeks, and sparkling eyes, twinkling from the shadow
      of a twisted toque; then over her would sweep a whirlwind of other
      dancers, and identities would become inextricably confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd-looking man, with a sad face and marvellously long, thin legs in
      tights, did incredible things with those members; he was merely a long
      spring without bones, joints, or hinges. His cadaverous face and
      glittering black eyes, above which rose a top-hat that never moved from
      place, completed the oddity of his appearance. He is always there in the
      thickest of the dancing, and his salary is three francs a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suddenly discovered Mr. Thompkins in a most embarrassing situation. A
      bewitching chemical blonde of the clinging type had discovered and
      appropriated him; she melted all over him, and poured a stream of bad
      English into his ear. She was so very, very thirsty, she pleaded, and
      Monsieur was so charming, so much a gentleman,&mdash;he was beautiful,
      too. Oh, Monsieur would not be so unkind as to remove the soft, plump arm
      from round his neck,&mdash;surely it did not hurt Monsieur, for was it not
      warm and plump, and was not that a pretty dimple in the elbow, and another
      even prettier in the shoulder? If Monsieur were not so charming and
      gracious the ladies would never, never fall in love with him like this.
      And oh, Monsieur, the place was so warm, and dancing makes one so thirsty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins's face was a picture of shame and despair, and I have never
      seen a more comical expression than that with which he looked appealingly
      to us for help. Suppose some one in the hall should happen to recognize
      him! Of course there was only one thing to do. Mademoiselle Blanche's
      thirst was of that awful kind which only shipwrecked sailors, travellers
      lost in a desert, and <i>café</i> dancing-girls can understand. And so
      four glasses of beer were ordered. It was beautiful to see the grace and
      celerity with which Mademoiselle Blanche disposed of hers, the passionate
      eagerness with which she pressed a long kiss upon Mr. Thompkins's
      unwilling lips, and the promptness with which she then picked up his
      glass, drained it while she looked at him mischievously over the rim,
      kissed him again, and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thompkins sat speechless, his face blazing, his whole expression
      indescribably foolish. He vigorously wiped his lips with his handkerchief,
      and was not himself again for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innumerable bright little comedies were unconsciously played in all parts
      of the room, and they were even more interesting than the antics of the
      dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We presently strolled into the garden of the Moulin, where a performance
      is given in the summer. There stood a great white sheet-iron elephant,
      remindful of Coney Island. In one of the legs was a small door, from which
      a winding stair led into the body of the beast. The entrance fee was fifty
      centimes, the ticket-office at the top of the stair. It was a small room
      inside the elephant, and there was a small stage in the end of it, upon
      which three young women were exercising their abdominal muscles in the
      danse du ventre. Mr. Thompkins, dismayed at this, would have fled had not
      Bishop captured him and hauled him back to a conspicuous seat, where the
      dancing-girls, quickly finding him, proceeded to make their work as
      extravagant as possible, throwing him wicked glances meanwhile, and
      manifestly enjoying his embarrassment. Of course the dancers came round
      presently for offerings of sous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We returned to the dance-hall, for it was now closing-up time, and in
      order to feel a touch of kinship with America, drank a gin fizz at the
      American bar, though it seemed to be a novelty to Mr. Thompkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were alive with the revellers who had been turned out by the
      closing of the <i>café</i>s, dancehalls, and theatres, and the cries of
      cabbies rose above the din of laughter and chatter among the crowds. But
      the night was not yet quite finished. Said Bishop,&mdash;"We shall now
      have coffee at the Red Ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was below the Place Pigalle, quite a walk down to the Rue de
      Maubeuge, through that suddenly quiet centre of artists' studios and
      dignified residences. At last we reached L'Âne Rouage,&mdash;the Red Ass.
      It has a small and unassuming front, except that the window-panes are
      profusely decorated with painted flowers and figures, and a red ass peers
      down over the narrow door. L'Âne Rouge has no special distinction, save
      its artistic interior and the fanciful sketches on its walls. It is
      furnished with heavy dark tables and chairs, and iron grilled into
      beautiful scrolls and chandeliers,&mdash;like the famous Chat Noir, near
      by. In fact, L'Âne Rouge resembles an old curiosity shop more than
      anything else, for it is filled with all imaginable kinds of antiques,
      blackened by age and smoke, and in perfect harmony. It, too, has its
      particular clientèle of Bohemians, who come to puff their long pipes that
      hang in racks, and recount their hopes, aspirations, achievements, and
      failures, occasionally breaking into song. For this they bring forth their
      mandolins and guitars, and sing sentimental ditties of their own
      composition. There is a charming air of chez soi at the Red Ass; a spirit
      of good-fellowship pervades it; and then, the <i>café</i> is small, cosey,
      and comfortable, as well as artistic.

      It was in a lively commotion when we crossed the threshold, the place
      being filled with littérateurs of the quarter. A celebration was in
      progress,&mdash;one of their number had just succeeded in finding a
      publisher for two volumes of his poetry. It was a notable event, and the
      lucky Bohemian, flushed with money, had settled his debts and was now
      treating his friends. Although we were strangers to him, he cordially
      invited us to share the hospitality of the occasion, and there was great
      applause when Bishop presented him with a Brevas cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bravo, les Anglais! Ce sont des bons types, ceux-là!</i>" and then
      they sang in chorus, a happy, careless, jolly crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small, thin young sketch artist making crayon portraits of the
      successful poet and selling them to the poet's friends for fifty centimes
      apiece,&mdash;with the poet's autograph, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a call for une chanson Anglaise, Bishop sang "Down on the
      Farm" as he had never sung it before, his shining top-hat pushed back upon
      his curly hair, his jovial face beaming. At its conclusion he proposed a
      toast to the successful poet, and it was drunk standing and with a mighty
      shout.

      We looked in at the Cabaret des Quat'z' Arts,&mdash;a bright and showy
      place, but hardly more suggestive of student Bohemianism than the other
      fine <i>café</i>s of the boulevards.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus ended a night on Montmartre. We left Mr. Thompkins at his hotel.
      I think he was more than satisfied, but he was too bewildered and tired to
      say much about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montmartre presents the extravagant side of Parisian Bohemianism. If there
      is a thing to be mocked, a convention to be outraged, an idol to be
      destroyed, Montmartre will find the way. But it has a taint of sordidness
      that the real Bohemianism of the old Latin Quarter lacks,&mdash;for it is
      not the Bohemianism of the students. And it is vulgar. For all that, in
      its rude, reckless, and brazen way it is singularly picturesque. It is not
      likely that Mr. Thompkins will say much about it when he goes home, but he
      will be able to say a great deal in a general way about the harm of
      ridiculing sacred things and turning reverence into a laugh.

      MOVING IN THE QUARTIER LATIN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Quartier Latin
      takes on unwonted life about the fifteenth of July, when the artists and
      students change their places of abode under the resistless pressure of a
      nomadic spirit.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Studios are generally taken for terms ranging from three months to a year,
      and the terms generally expire in July. The artists who do not change
      their residence then go into the country, and that means moving their
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a familiar fact that artists do not generally occupy a high position
      in the financial world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently they are a very practical lot, attending to their own
      domestic duties (including washing when times are hard), and doing their
      own moving when July comes; but this is not a very elaborate undertaking,
      the worse of them for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in July Bishop and I sat in our window overlooking the court, and
      observed the comedy of a
    </p>
    <h3>
      A STUDENT MOVING
    </h3>
    <p>
      No one thinks student in the throes of moving. The old building at the end
      of our court was a favorite abiding-place for artists. Evidently, on this
      day, a young artist or art student was <i>en déménagement</i>, for his
      household goods were being dragged down the stairs and piled in the court
      preparatory to a journey in a small hand-cart standing by. He was
      cheerfully assisted by a number of his friends and his devoted companion,
      a pretty little grisette. There were eight of them in all, and their
      laughter and shouts indicated the royal fun they were having.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was one of those voitures à bras that are kept for hire at a
      neighboring location de voitures à bras at six sous an hour. In order to
      get locomotion out of it you have to hitch yourself in the harness that
      accompanies it, and pull the vehicle yourself; and that is no end of fun,
      because your friends are helping and singing all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this vehicle they placed a rickety old divan and a very much
      dilapidated mattress; then came half a sack of coal, a tiny, rusty, round
      studio stove with interminable yards of battered and soot-filled pipe, a
      pine table, two rush-bottomed chairs, and a big box filled with clattering
      dishes, kettles, pots, and pans. On top of this came a thick roll of
      dusty, faded, threadbare hangings and rugs, and the meagre wardrobes of
      the artist and the grisette; then a number of hat-boxes, after which
      Mademoiselle looked with great solicitude. Last of all came bulky
      portfolios filled with the artist's work, a large number of canvases that
      were mostly studies of Mademoiselle au naturel, with such accessories as
      easel, paint-boxes, and the like, and the linen and bedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat old concierge stood grumbling near by, for the ropes were being
      tied over the load, and she was anxiously waiting for her <i>dernier adieu</i>,
      or parting tip, that it is the custom to give upon surrendering the key.
      But tips are sometimes hard to give, and Bohemian etiquette does not
      regard them with general favor. After the load had been made snug, the
      artist approached the concierge, doffed his cap, bowed low, and then in a
      most impressively ceremonious manner handed her the key, avowed that it
      broke his heart to leave her, and commended her to God. That was all.
      There seems to be a special providence attending upon the vocabulary of
      concierges in their hour of need. The shrill, condemnatory, interminable
      vocalization of this concierge's wrath indicated specific abilities of
      exceptional power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the artist paid no attention. He hung his coat and "plug" hat on the
      inverted table-leg, got between the shafts, hitched himself in the
      harness, and sailed out of the court, his friends swarming around and
      assisting him to drag the toppling cart away. And this they did with a
      mighty will, yelling and singing with a vigor that wholly obliterated the
      concierge's noise. The little grisette closed the procession, bearing in
      one hand a lamp and in the other a fragile bust. And so the merry party
      started, possibly for the other end of Paris,&mdash;the greater the
      distance the more the fun. They all knew that when the voiture had been
      unloaded and all had fallen to and assisted the young couple in
      straightening out their new home, there would be a jolly celebration in
      the nearest <i>café</i> at the moving artist's expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the start was made fairly and smoothly; but the enthusiasm of the crowd
      was so high and the little vehicle was so top-heavy, that at the end of
      the passage the comedy seemed about to merge into a tragedy. It was
      announced to all the court in the shrill voice of the concierge, who
      exultingly screamed,&mdash;"The stove has fallen out! and the coal! The
      things are falling all over the street! Oh, you villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To the movers themselves it was merely an incident that added to the fun
      and zest of the enterprise.

    <p>
      My plans carried me to Concarneau, and Bishop's took him to Italy, where I
      would join him after a while. And a royal time we had in our several ways.
      The autumn found us fresh and eager for our studies in Paris again, and so
      we returned to hunt a studio and establish ourselves in new quarters. We
      had stored our goods with a kind American friend; and as we had neither
      the desire nor the financial ability to violate the traditions of the
      Quartier, we greatly scandalized him and his charming family by appearing
      one day with a crowd of students and a voiture à bras before his house and
      taking our effects away in the traditional fashion. Of course our friend
      would have gladly paid for the transport of our belongings in a more
      respectable fashion; but where would have been the fun in that? I am
      pleased to say that with true American adaptiveness he joined the singing
      and yelling crowd, and danced a jig to our playing in our new quarters
      after a generous brew of punch had done its share in the jollity of the
      event.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, dear old Paris! wonderful, bewildering Paris! alluring, enchanting
      Paris! Our student years are now just ended, and Paris is already so
      crowded with workers who cannot bear to leave it that we must seek our
      fortune in other and duller parts of the world. But Paris has ineradicably
      impressed itself upon us. We have lived its life; we have been a part of
      its throbbing, working, achieving individuality. What we take away will be
      of imperishable value, the salt and leaven of our hopes and efforts
      forever.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
